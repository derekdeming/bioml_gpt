SUMMARY The adipocyte-derived hormone adiponectin promotes metabolic and cardiovascular health. Circulating adiponectin increases in lean states such as caloric restriction (CR), but the reasons for this paradox remain unclear. Unlike white adipose tissue (WAT), bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT) increases during CR, and both MAT and serum adiponectin increase in many other clinical conditions. Thus, we investigated if MAT contributes to circulating adiponectin. We find that adiponectin secretion is greater from MAT than from WAT. Notably, specific inhibition of MAT formation in mice results in decreased circulating adiponectin during CR, despite unaltered adiponectin expression in WAT. Inhibiting MAT formation also alters skeletal muscle adaptation to CR, suggesting that MAT exerts systemic effects. Finally, we reveal that both", "completion": ""}

These observations identify MAT as an endocrine organ that contributes significantly to increased serum adiponectin during CR, and perhaps in other adverse states. INTRODUCTION White adipose tissue (WAT) is a major endocrine organ that exerts diverse systemic effects. One of the most extensively studied adipocyte-secreted factors is the hormone adiponectin, which promotes insulin sensitivity, fat oxidation, anti-atherogenic and anti-cancer effects (Ye and Scherer, 2013). Serum adiponectin is also a well-established biomarker for insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease; indeed, circulating adiponectin is low in obese, insulin-resistant individuals and in other adverse metabolic states (Ye and Scherer, 2013). Conversely, serum adiponectin increases in lean, insulin-sensitive states such as with calorie restriction (CR) in animals and anorexia nervosa (AN) in humans (Combs et al., 2003; Dolezalova et al., 2007; Pannacciulli et al., 2003). Reduced circulating adiponectin in obesity likely derives from decreased adiponectin expression and secretion, which may result from mitochondrial dysfunction or aberrantly increased inflammation, hypoxia or endoplasmic reticulum stress (Ye and Scherer, 2013). Far less is known about why serum adiponectin increases in lean states. Although some studies report increased adiponectin expression in WAT during extensive CR (Qiao et al., 2011), most studies in mice and humans find that prolonged CR or extensive weight loss increases serum adiponectin without affecting adiponectin expression or secretion from WAT (Behre et al., 2007; Combs et al., 2003; Kovacova et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2006). Indeed, adiponectin expression in WAT decreases in human subjects with AN (Dolezalova et al., 2007). Adiponectin clearance is also unaltered during CR (Qiao et al., 2011). Thus, in lean states such as CR or AN, theCawthorn et al. Page 2 Cell Metab . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 August 05. NIH-PA Author", "completion": ""}

Our knowledge of adiponectin derives from extensive study of WAT biology over the past generation. In comparison, metabolic research has largely neglected another adipose depot: bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT). Bone marrow (BM) adipocytes were identified over a century ago, and MAT accounts for approximately 70% of BM volume in adult humans (Fazeli et al., 2013). In striking contrast to WAT, MAT markedly increases during CR in animals, including humans (Devlin, 2011). Thus, in this manuscript we investigate the hypothesis that MAT is a source of circulating adiponectin in states of leanness. We provide direct evidence that MAT is required for maximal increases in serum adiponectin during CR. RESULTS Anorexia nervosa is associated with increased serum adiponectin and MAT Previous studies have not assessed both serum adiponectin and BM adiposity in a single cohort of AN subjects. Thus, we completed both analyses in a group of AN subjects and healthy controls (HC). Body mass index (BMI), adiposity and bone mineral density (BMD) were significantly lower in AN compared to HC subjects (Table 1). AN subjects had significantly higher MAT of the L4 vertebrae, femoral metaphysis and femoral diaphysis, and increased total and HMW serum adiponectin, despite decreased total fat mass (Table 1). Further calculations revealed that MAT comprised 13.0% of total adipose mass in HC subjects and 31.5% in AN subjects. This striking increase strongly suggests that, during CR, MAT exists in an amount that has clear potential to exert systemic effects through secretion of endocrine factors such as adiponectin. The relative expression and secretion of adiponectin is greater from MAT than from WAT The ability of MAT to express or secrete adiponectin has not been addressed. To do so, we took advantage of the fact that, in mice, BM of lumbar", "completion": ""}

We found that adiponectin expression in CV of C57BL/6J mice was similar to that in inguinal WAT (iWAT), gonadal WAT (gWAT), and perirenal WAT (pWAT) (Fig 1B). In contrast, expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- γ (PPAR γ) was similar between WAT and CV of some mice, but much lower in CV of other mice. Other adipocyte proteins, such as fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) and perilipin A, were also markedly decreased in CV compared to WAT, while hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) expression was undetectable in CV (Fig 1B). Similar results were observed in C3H/HeJ mice (Fig S1A). However, because CV also contain many non-adipocyte populations, expression of adipocyte proteins in CV lysates might be diluted compared to that in WAT. Therefore, we next analyzed pure MAT from rabbit tibiae, in which there is a gradient of increasing adiposity from proximal to distal (Fig 1C). This pattern of MAT distribution, which is also typical of that in humans (Scheller and Rosen, 2014), allowed us to isolate intact pieces of pure MAT or red marrow (RM). No trabecular bone was observed in any of the MAT samples (Fig 1D). As in mice, adiponectin protein was robustly expressed in rabbit MATCawthorn et al. Page 3 Cell Metab .

Expression of Pparg was similar between MAT and WAT, whereas Cebpa and Lep were lower in MAT (Fig S1B). These observations show that, compared to WAT, MAT expresses adiponectin at disproportionately high levels relative to other typical adipocyte transcripts and proteins. To investigate the ability of MAT to secrete adiponectin, we cultured rabbit MAT and WAT explants and analyzed adiponectin secretion into conditioned media.

To test if these observations extend to humans, we characterized WAT and MAT from three patients undergoing below-the-knee amputation. Unlike rabbit MAT, bone fragments were interspersed with MAT in two of the three samples (Fig 1G). Nevertheless, adiponectin expression was greater in MAT than in WAT (Fig 1H). Strikingly, adiponectin secretion was also markedly higher from explants of MAT than from WAT, despite a similar degree of explant breakdown and total protein content of the conditioned media (Fig 1I; Fig S1D). These results demonstrate that human MAT has a greater capacity than WAT to both express and secrete adiponectin. MAT directly contributes to increased serum adiponectin during CR The above results are consistent with our hypothesis that MAT is a source of circulating adiponectin. However, our observations in AN subjects are correlative; therefore, we next directly tested if MAT expansion is required for increased serum adiponectin with CR. To do so we used Ocn-Wnt10b mice, which overexpress Wnt10b from osteoblasts (Bennett et al., 2007). Wnt10b potently inhibits adipogenesis; hence, we hypothesized that Ocn-Wnt10b mice would resist MAT expansion with CR, allowing us to test if increased MAT is required for elevated serum adiponectin in this context. We fed wild-type (WT) and Ocn-Wnt10b mice a control or 30% CR diet for 6 weeks. In female mice of both genotypes, CR significantly decreased body mass, blood glucose, lean mass, and liver mass, but not fat mass (Fig S2A-C; Fig 2A). Though not intuitive, this preservation of fat mass in female C57BL/6J mice is consistent with previous CR studies (Li et al., 2010; Varady et al., 2010). Other expected effects of CR on WAT were also noted, including increased expression of fatty acid synthase protein (FAS) and transcripts ( Fasn ) (Fig S2D-F) (Bruss et al., 2010).

We next used osmium tetroxide staining to assess BM adiposity (Fig 2B-C). On a control diet, MAT did not significantly differ between WT and Ocn-Wnt10b mice. CR markedly increased MAT in WT mice; however, this increase was significantly blunted in Ocn-Wnt10b mice. Further analysis of whole tibiae and femurs revealed that CR increased expression of the adipocyte markers Fabp4, Pparg and Lep in bones of WT mice, but not in Ocn-Wnt10b mice (Fig S2H). Thus, both osmium tetroxide staining and qPCR demonstrate that Ocn-Wnt10b mice resist MAT expansion during CR. Strikingly, CR-associated increases in serum adiponectin were also significantly blunted in Ocn-Wnt10b mice: HMW adiponectin was over two-foldCawthorn et al. Page 4 Cell Metab .

These differences are unlikely to be caused by differential hemoconcentration (Naruse et al., 2005), because silver staining revealed similar total serum protein content across all four groups (data not shown). We cannot exclude the possibility that adiponectin secretion from WAT is lower in Ocn-Wnt10b mice; however, WAT expression of Gstk1 and Erp44, which encode regulators of adiponectin secretion (Ye and Scherer, 2013), was unaffected by CR or transgenic Wnt10b (Fig S2F). These data are consistent with the finding that adiponectin secretion from WAT is unaltered during CR (Kovacova et al., 2009). Importantly, neither CR nor transgenic Wnt10b affected expression of Adipoq transcripts or protein in WAT (Fig 2F; Fig S2D-E). Thus, altered adiponectin expression in WAT does not account for the observed differences in serum adiponectin.

These results therefore provide direct evidence that MAT expansion is necessary for maximal production of serum adiponectin during CR. Impaired MAT expansion alters skeletal muscle adaptations to CR We next investigated if limiting the increases in MAT or adiponectin during CR has wider metabolic consequences. In obese states, lack of adiponectin causes glucose intolerance (Maeda et al., 2002; Ye and Scherer, 2013). However, glucose tolerance did not differ between WT and Ocn-Wnt10b mice (Fig S2I). This is consistent with adiponectin deficiency not affecting glucose tolerance in lean mice (Maeda et al., 2002). Expected effects of adiponectin or CR on liver transcript expression, including increased Pparg, Ppara, and Hnf4a , and decreased Fabp5 (Liu et al., 2012; Nogueira et al., 2012), also did not differ between WT and Ocn-Wnt10b mice (Fig S3). Therefore, we next analyzed skeletal muscle, a major metabolic target of adiponectin. Here, adiponectin stimulates Ca2+ influx and LKB1 activation, thereby enhancing AMPK activity, PPAR γ coactivator-1 α (PGC-1 α) expression, and mitochondrial biogenesis (Ye and Scherer, 2013). Consistent with a previous report (Finley et al., 2012), in WT mice CR increased expression of Pgc1a and its downstream targets, Tfam and Acadm (Fig 2H), which encode proteins with important mitochondrial functions. Strikingly, these effects of CR were absent in Ocn-Wnt10b mice (Fig 2H). In contrast, hepatic expression of Pgc1a and Tfam did not differ between genotypes (Fig S3), suggesting that consequences of impaired MAT expansion are specific to skeletal muscle. As reported elsewhere (Gonzalez et al., 2004), CR in WT mice did not affect steady-state AMPK activity in muscle (Fig 2I-J). Two pathways upstream of AMPK activation, LKB1 and Ca2+/calmodulin signaling, were also unaffected by CR in WT mice (Fig 2I-J). In contrast, CR markedly activated AMPK and CaMKII", "completion": ""}

Both MAT and circulating adiponectin increase during cancer therapy in humans The above findings in humans, rabbits, and mice identify MAT as a key source of circulating adiponectin during CR. We next began to explore this relationship in other clinical conditions. BM adiposity increases during radiotherapy or chemotherapy for cancer; hence, we hypothesized that serum adiponectin might also increase during such treatments.Cawthorn et al. Page 5 Cell Metab . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 August 05. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptTo address this possibility, we analyzed MAT and serum adiponectin in patients undergoing therapy for ovarian or endometrial cancer. We found that both lumbar vertebral MAT and total serum adiponectin increased significantly at 6 and 12 months after onset of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, despite no change in total body fat (Fig 3A-D). Thus, both MAT and serum adiponectin increase during cancer therapy, without changes in total adiposity outside of the BM. This suggests that MAT might contribute to circulating adiponectin in contexts beyond CR. DISCUSSION Previous studies have investigated BM adipocytes as local regulators of skeletal remodeling (Scheller and Rosen, 2014); however, the present study is the first to identify MAT as an endocrine organ. We show that compared to WAT, MAT of mice and rabbits expresses adiponectin more highly than other adipocyte markers. Moreover, we reveal that secretion of adiponectin is far greater from MAT than from WAT of rabbits and humans. Our observations in AN subjects show that MAT can make up over 30% of total body fat, underscoring the notion that, during CR in humans, MAT exists in amounts sufficient to make a major contribution to circulating adiponectin.

We show that with CR, these mice resist increases in both MAT and serum adiponectin, without differences in WAT mass or adiponectin expression in WAT. It should be noted that, in some contexts, CR can increase adiponectin expression in WAT (Qiao et al., 2011); however, our findings are consistent with previous studies (Behre et al., 2007; Combs et al., 2003; Dolezalova et al., 2007; Kovacova et al., 2009), which collectively suggest that elevated circulating adiponectin during CR can occur without increased adiponectin production from WAT. Notably, our results in Ocn-Wnt10b mice greatly extend these earlier studies by providing direct evidence that MAT is a key source of circulating adiponectin during CR. Thus, adiponectin production from MAT may account, at least in part, for the adiponectin paradox. By producing adiponectin, MAT has the potential to exert systemic effects on metabolic homeostasis, immune responses, vascular function or cancer risk. Indeed, we find that impaired MAT expansion during CR leads to altered metabolic adaptations in skeletal muscle, suggesting that MAT has effects beyond the skeleton. However, whether these effects are driven by changes in circulating adiponectin remains unclear. For example, the CR-associated increase in Pgc1a, Tfam and Acadm in muscle of WT, but not Ocn-Wnt10b mice, is consistent with the differences in circulating adiponectin, whereas increased AMPK and CaMKII α activation with CR in Ocn-Wnt10b, but not WT mice, is highly unexpected. One possibility is that skeletal muscle of Ocn-Wnt10b mice adapts metabolically to a relative adiponectin deficiency by sustaining Ca2+/calmodulin and AMPK activation. However, even in WT mice, skeletal muscle AMPK activity does not increase during CR (Fig 2I-J) (Gonzalez et al., 2004), despite increased circulating adiponectin. This suggests that, during CR, adiponectin does not stimulate AMPK in muscle. Indeed, existing knowledge of adiponectin action is", "completion": ""}

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptiWAT and pWAT, and silver staining of human MAT- and WAT-conditioned media indicates that these tissues have distinct secretory profiles. These observations suggest that unique endocrine functions of MAT extend beyond adiponectin. Finally, we reveal that both MAT and circulating adiponectin increase in patients undergoing cancer therapy. Based on these findings, it is tempting to speculate that the increased adiponectin derives from MAT expansion. Given that low circulating adiponectin is associated with increased cancer risk, and that adiponectin can limit tumor growth (Dalamaga et al., 2012), the consequences of elevated adiponectin during cancer therapy clearly warrant further investigation. Beyond cancer, many other conditions are associated with increases in both MAT and circulating adiponectin, including aging, estrogen deficiency, type 1 diabetes, and treatment with pharmacologic agents such as thiazolidinediones or fibroblast growth factor-21 (Combs et al., 2003; Fazeli et al., 2013; Isobe et al., 2005; Kharitonenkov et al., 2007; Scheller and Rosen, 2014; Wei et al., 2012; Ye and Scherer, 2013). This suggests that MAT might impact upon circulating adiponectin in other clinically relevant conditions. In addition, both circulating adiponectin and MAT volume inversely correlate with BMD in human populations (Richards et al., 2007; Shen et al., 2012).

Canonical Wnt/b-catenin signaling is established as an important endogenous inhibitor of adipogenesis. This pathway is operative in mature adipocytes; however, its roles in this context remain unclear due to complexities of Wnt signaling and differences in experimental models. In this study, we used novel cultured cell and mouse models to investigate functional roles of Wnts secreted from adipocytes.Methods: We generated adipocyte-speci ﬁc Wntless ( Wls) knockout mice and cultured cell models to investigate molecular and metabolic consequences of disrupting Wnt secretion from mature adipocytes. To characterize Wls-deﬁcient cultured adipocytes, we evaluated the expression of Wnt target and lipogenic genes and the downstream functional effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. We also investigatedthe impact of adipocyte-speci ﬁcWls deletion on adipose tissues and global glucose metabolism in mice fed normal chow or high-fat diets. Results: Many aspects of the Wnt signaling apparatus are expressed and operative in mature adipocytes, including the Wnt chaperone Wntless. Deletion of Wntless in cultured adipocytes results in the inhibition of de novo lipogenesis and lipid monounsaturation, likely through repression of Srebf1 (SREBP1c) and Mlxipl (ChREBP) and impaired cleavage of immature SREBP1c into its active form.

Thus, after six months of a high-fat diet, Wls-/-mice are characterized by decreased adipocyte lipogenic gene expression, reduced visceral adiposity, and improved glucose homeostasis. Conclusions: Taken together, these studies demonstrate that adipocyte-derived Wnts regulate de novo lipogenesis and lipid desaturation and coordinate the expression of lipogenic genes in adipose tissues. In addition, we report that Wnt signaling within adipose tissues is defended, such that a loss of Wnt secretion from adipocytes is sensed and compensated for by neighboring stromal-vascular cells. With chronic overnutrition, this compensatory mechanism is lost, revealing that Wls-/-mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity, adipocyte hypertrophy, and metabolic dysfunction. /C2112020 The Author(s).

INTRODUCTION Wnts are members of an evolutionarily conserved family of secreted glycoproteins with established roles in cell proliferation and differen- tiation during tissue development [ 1,2]. When canonical Wnts bind totheir membrane-spanning frizzled (Fzd) receptors and low-density li- poprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) co-receptors, they trigger anintracellular signaling cascade that stabilizes free cytosolic b-catenin, which then translocates to the nucleus and coactivates DNA-binding T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (TCF/LEF) proteins to 1Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA2Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA3Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology,", "completion": ""}

The endogenous Wnt pathway is a critical regulator of mesenchymal cell fat, inhibiting adipogenesis and promoting osteogenesis. [ 4e18]. Genetic studies in humans have also identi ﬁed associations between Wnt pathway members and body fat distribution, obesity, and metabolic function. For example, genome-wide association studies across diverse human populations have found strong correlations between poly-morphisms in the canonical Wnt transcriptional effector TCF7L2 and susceptibility to type 2 diabetes [ 19e21];", "completion": ""}
{"prompt": "indeed, TCF7L2 is one of the strongest risk loci for development of type 2 diabetes. In addition, loss-of-function mutations in Wnt co-receptors LRP5 and LRP6 are associated with impaired glucose tolerance, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular dis- ease [ 22,23], whereas gain-of-function LRP5 mutations are associated with increased adiposity and altered fat distribution [ 24]. Common vari- ants in Wnt signaling inhibitor ZNRF3 and Wnt signaling activator RSPO3 are associated with increased waist-to-hip ratio [ 25e27]. Further, gain- of-function mutations in LGR4 , a protein that stabilizes Wnt receptors, are correlated with increased visceral adiposity [ 28]. Polymorphisms in the SFRP5 locus have been associated with decreased adiposity in men [ 29], whereas missense variants in WNT10B and certain WNT5B single nucleotide polymorphisms are correlated with higher risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, respectively [ 30,31]. Recently, variants in CTNNB1 ( b- catenin) have been linked to increased body mass index and risk ofobesity [ 32]. Taken together, these studies provide strong genetic evi- dence for the in ﬂuence of Wnt/ b-catenin signaling on white adipose tissue (WAT) function, body composition, and metabolic health.Although recent studies have dem onstrated that Wnt signaling is active in mature adipocytes, its functional roles in this context remain unclear due to the complexity of the Wnt pathway and differences in experimental m odels, approaches, and results [13,14,32e34]. For example, stabilizatio n of Wnt signaling through global deletion of secreted frizzl ed-related protein 5 (SFRP5), an adipocyte protein highly induced by obesity that binds to and se-questers Wnts, causes resistance to diet-induced obesity in mice [33]. Whereas total adipocyte numbers are unaffected, adipocytes inSfrp5 mutant mice have increased mitochondrial numbers and are smaller in size compared to control mice, resulting in reducedWAT and improved glucose tol erance.

In contrast, adipocyte-speci ﬁc deletion of the tran- scription factor Tcf7l2 leads to adipocyte hypertrophy and impaired glucose homeostasis with diet-induced obesity [ 34]. These reports provide the ﬁrst evidence that canonic al Wnt signaling regulates ability of existing adipocytes to accommodate excess energy. Additional studies targeting the Wnt pathway in adipocytes arerequired to further understand how various components of this pathway differentially contri bute to adipocyte metabolism. Although it is clear that Wnt signaling is important within adiposetissues, one signi ﬁcant gap in our knowledge is the cellular source of physiologically relevant Wnts. To address this shortfall, we tar- geted Wntless ( Wls), an evolutionarily conserved chaperone protein required for the transport of Wnts from the endoplasmic reticulum(ER) and Golgi apparatus to the cell membrane for secretion [35,36]. Wnt proteins are modi ﬁed with palmitoleic acid (C16:1) at conserved serine residues, and the lipocalin-like structure ofWntless may facilitate bindi ng to these hydrophobic modi ﬁcations [37e41]. In fact, palmitoleoylation at Ser209 of Wnt3a mediates its physical binding to Wntless and subsequent release from the ER,and is thought to be required for Wnt activity [ 37,42,43]. Deletion of Wntless in vertebrate and invertebrate animal models results inphenotypes consistent with loss of Wnt function, suggesting that Wntless regulates signaling at the level of Wnt transport and secretion in signal-producing cells [ 36,44e50]. In this paper, we report that Wntless is expressed in mature adipocytesand that Wlsdeletion leads to reduced de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and lipid monounsaturation. Further, inhibition of a network of lipogenic genes is correlated with repression of Srebf1 andMlxipl , which encode SREBP1c and ChREBP, known transcriptional regulators of this gene set [ 51e53].

{"prompt": "chow diet (NCD), loss of adipocyte-speci ﬁc Wnt secretion is defended by increased expression of Wnts in the surrounding stromal-vascular cells (SVC); however, this compensation is lost in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Thus, Wls -/-mice challenged with long-term HFD demonstrate decreased adipocyte lipogenic gene expression, reduced size ofepididymal adipocytes and WAT, and resistance to HFD-induced metabolic dysfunction. Studies from the cancer ﬁeld have ﬁrmly established that inhibition of stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), whichcatalyzes the synthesis of palmitoleic acid, results in suppression of Wnt/ b-catenin signaling [ 41,54e61]. Our studies reveal a reciprocal relationship in which Wnts are required for the expression of lipogenicgenes and DNL, including the expression of SCD1 and formation of palmitoleic acid. Thus, these results highlight the novel and important roles of adipocyte-derived Wnts in critical mature adipocyte functions,including the accumulation of lipids in WAT with HFD. 2.

Wntless is expressed in mature adipocytes and upregulated by diet-induced obesity Canonical Wnt signaling has previously been established as a signif-icant endogenous regulator of adipogenesis [ 4]. Although recent studies have provided compelling evidence that this pathway also plays a role in the metabolism of adipocytes [ 32e34], particularly under obesogenic conditions, the contribution of adipocyte-derivedWnt proteins has not been directly studied in this context. To this end, we ﬁrst evaluated whether Wntless, the chaperone protein required for secretion of Wnts, is expressed and regulated in culturedadipocytes and WAT. In cultured MSCs derived from wild-type C57BL/ 6J mice, the expression of Wls mRNA and protein was high in pre- cursors, transiently repressed during differentiation, and elevatedagain in mature adipocytes ( Figure 1 A,B). As expected, mRNA and protein expression of the adipocyte marker Adipoq (adiponectin) increased during adipogenesis, whereas the expression of the pre-adipocyte marker Dlk1 (Pref1) decreased ( Figure 1 A,B). In addition to adipocytes, WAT contains myriad cell types, including preadipocytes, stromal cells, endothelial cells, and immune cells. These cells comprise the SVF of WAT and many have been shown tohave active Wnt signaling in other contexts [ 5,6,70e72]. We measured WlsmRNA in fractionated eWAT and iWAT of C57BL/6J mice and found that it is expressed at higher levels in isolated adipocytes than in theSVF ( Figure 1 C). We then conducted immunoblot analyses on various mouse tissues and observed that Wntless is highly expressed in diverse adipose depots ( Figure 1 D) with relatively low abundance in the lungs and pancreas. Once we established that Wls is expressed in mouse adipose tissues, we explored whether its expression in WAT is regulated by nutritional or environmental challenges. We found that Wlsgene expression", "completion": ""}
{"prompt": "in eWAT and iWAT is upregulated by diet-induced obesity ( Figure 1 E); notably, this increase in Wls expression occurrs speci ﬁcally in the adipocyte fraction and not in the SVF of eWAT and iWAT ( Supplemental Figure 1A ). Further, Wls is speci ﬁcally regulated by HFD feeding as its expression is not altered by acute fasting, fasting/ refeeding, calorie restriction, or acute cold exposure ( Supplemental Figure 1B ). Wntless protein expression is also upregulated by diet- induced obesity in eWAT and iWAT ( Figure 1 F). We also queried the publicly available GTEx dataset to determine the distribution of Wls gene expression across male and female human tissues and found thatWls is expressed at higher levels in WAT depots when compared to liver or skeletal muscle ( Supplemental Figure 1C ). These data suggest that Wntless, which is expressed in adipocytes and induced by obesity, likely plays a metabolic role in these cells, particularly under obeso-genic conditions. 3.2. Wnt/ b-catenin signaling is operative in cultured adipocytes Although previous studies have characterized in detail the mechanisms by which Wnt signaling represses adipogenesis of mesenchymal precursors and promotes alternative cell fates [ 4,5,15,17,18], the expression pattern and roles of Wnt-related proteins in mature adi-pocytes is less clear. RNA-seq analyses of cultured MSCs anddifferentiated adipocytes revealed that many Wnts are induced during adipogenesis, including Wnt2b ,Wnt4 ,Wnt5b ,Wnt8b ,Wnt9a , and Wnt9b (Figure 1 G). We also observed the induction of Fzd4 and Fzd9 receptors and constitutive expression of other pathway members, suchasCtnnb1 ( b-catenin), Lrp5 ,Lrp6 ,Sfrp1 ,Dvl1, Dvl2 ,Dvl3, Wnt16 , Wnt2 , and Wnt7b (Supplemental Figure 1D ). Consistent with all major components of the signaling pathway being either induced orexpressed constitutively, a number of downstream Wnt targets were elevated in mature adipocytes, including Wisp1 ,Wisp2 ,Axin2 ,Tcf7l2 , and Tcf7l1 , among others.

Taken together, these data indicate that the canonicalWnt signaling apparatus is operative in mature adipocytes. 3.3. Wntless deletion in cultured adipocytes inhibits DNL and lipid monounsaturationTo study the molecular functions of Wntless in adipocytes, we isolated and cultured MSCs from the Wls ﬂ/ﬂmice. This model allowed us to conduct metabolic and mechanistic studies in cells derived directlyfrom our mouse model. Wls ﬂ/ﬂMSCs were differentiated into adipo- cytes using a standard adipogenic cocktail. At day four of differenti- ation, adipocytes were infected in serum-free medium with adenoviralGFP as a control or adenoviral Cre recombinase to induce Wls gene deletion. Adipocytes were allowed to recover following infection and analyzed at days 12 to 14 of differentiation ( Figure 2 A). Recombination of the ﬂoxed allele was con ﬁrmed by a 3-primer PCR system (Figure 2 B). Both qPCR and immunoblot analyses of Cre-infected ad- ipocytes showed ef ﬁcient deletion of Wlsat the mRNA ( Figure 2 C) and protein ( Figure 2 D) levels. Deletion of Wntless does not affect differ- entiation and lipid accumulation, as assessed by adiponectin protein expression ( Figure 2 D), phase-contrast microscopy and Oil Red-O staining ( Figure 2 E), and measurement of TAG ( Figure 2 F). To inves- tigate whether Wnt signaling is altered by Wlsdeletion, we measured the expression of known targets and found that Wnt-induced genes, including Axin2 ,Tcf7l2 ,Cmyc , and Ppard are down-regulated, whereas Wnt-suppressed gene Id2is up-regulated in Wls -/-adipocytes (Figure 2 G). The down-regulation of Wnt target genes in Wls-/-adi- pocytes is relatively mild, suggesting that other pathways contribute to basal expression of these genes.Of note, Ctnnb1 mRNA is not altered, which is consistent with its primary regulation through protein turnover [ 6,73].

Thus, we measured free cytosolic b-catenin as a surro- gate for Wnt signaling downstream of adipocyte-derived Wnts. Compared to Wlsﬂ/ﬂcells, we found that free cytosolic b-catenin is signi ﬁcantly lower ( w33%) in Wls-/-MSCs at baseline ( Figure 2 H; quanti ﬁed in Supplemental Figure 2A ). Interestingly, free cytosolic b- catenin also appears to be lower in Wls-/-MSCs upon stimulation with Wnt3a, which may be secondary to desensitization of the Wnt signaling pathway in the absence of Wntless and secreted Wnts. In contrast,similar levels of membrane b-catenin are observed in control and Wls-/-MSCs ( Figure 2 H; quanti ﬁed in Supplemental Figure 2A ). These data suggest that Wnt signaling is active in mature adipocytes andimpaired secretion of adipocyte-derived Wnts in ﬂuences downstream signaling in an autocrine/paracrine manner. Since Wntless functions to chaperone Wnt proteins from the ER andGolgi apparatus to the plasma membrane for secretion, we hypothe-sized that its deletion might in ﬂuence the adipocyte proteome.

Of these potential Wnt targets, we focused our investigations on the down- regulation of SCD1, an important adipocyte enzyme in the ER that catalyzes the desaturation of palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acidsinto palmitoleic (C16:1, n-7) and oleic (C18:1, n-9) acids, respectively [75,76]. In addition to its role as the rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid desaturation, SCD1 is also a key member of the DNL pathway(Figure 3 A), which converts excess dietary carbohydrates and amino acids into fatty acids. A subset of these fatty acids are esteri ﬁed to form TAG, which can later be hydrolyzed and fatty acids either secreted ormetabolized by b-oxidation to provide energy for adipocytes and other cells in the body [ 77,78].

In addition, we also observed coordinate regulation of several enzymes involved in DNL and lipid metabolism ( Figure 3 A and B; quanti ﬁed in Supplemental Figure 3A ). Given the w75% in- hibition of SCD1 following Wls deletion, we hypothesized that Wls-/- adipocytes would have impaired fatty acid monounsaturation and therefore a larger proportion of saturated fatty acids. Thus, we nextused GC to analyze the composition of esteri ﬁed fatty acids in total lipids extracted from Wls ﬂ/ﬂand Wls-/-adipocytes. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that Wls-/-adipocytes contain a smaller pro- portion of monounsaturated fatty acids compared to Wlsﬂ/ﬂadipocytes(Figure 3 C). More speci ﬁcally, compared to control adipocytes, differentiated Wls-/-cells contain higher levels of palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids and lower amounts of myristoleic (C14:1, n-5),palmitoleic (C16:1, n-7), and vaccenic (C18:1, n-7) acids ( Figure 3 De F). Of note, Wls -/-adipocytes contain mildly elevated levels of oleic acid (C18:1, n-9), consistent with previous reports of SCD1 inhibition in3T3-L1 adipocytes [ 79]. In addition to SCD1, Wls deletion also regulates the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, including repression of ATP citratelyase ( Acly/ACLY), acetyl-CoA carboxylase ( Acaca /ACC1), and fatty acid synthase ( Fasn /FASN) ( Figure 3 A,B). We therefore conducted DNL assays using [ 14C]-acetate to determine whether this pathway is less active in Wls-/-adipocytes. Cultured adipocytes were incubated in medium containing [14C]-acetate for 1, 2, 4 or 8 h. Cells were then collected and lipids were extracted to measure radiolabel incorporationinto TAG, diacylglycerol (DAG), and phospholipid (PL) fractions.

Taken together, these data demonstrate that deletion of Wntless coordinately represses a network of lipogenic genes, thus altering the rate oflipogenesis and steady-state lipid composition in cultured adipocytes.

Thus, we explored whether these proteins are regulated in Wls -/-adipocytes. We found that expression of Srebf1 and Mlxipl , which encode SREBP1c and ChREBP, respectively, are both down-regulated following the loss ofWntless, whereas other transcription factors involved in adipogenesis and adipocyte metabolism, including Pparg ,Lxra, and Lxrb, are not inﬂuenced ( Figure 4 A). Although PPAR gprotein was unchanged, Cebpa mRNA and protein were both slightly repressed in Wls-/-adi- pocytes, suggesting that this adipogenic transcription factor may also regulate lipogenic genes in mature adipocytes ( Figure 4 A, B). Impor- tantly, immunoblot analyses revealed that SREBP1c and ChREBPproteins are both repressed in Wls -/-adipocytes ( Figure 4 B), which is of interest since the literature to date has not reported regulation by Wnt signaling of Srebf1 orMlxipl in mature adipocytes. In addition,SREBP1c is post-translationally cleaved at the ER and only mature, soluble SREBP1c translocates to the nucleus to mediate gene tran- scription. Of note, we observed that whereas the mature form of SREBP1c ( w50 kDa relative mobility) is signi ﬁcantly decreased in the Wls-/-adipocytes, the larger immature form ( w100 kDa) is reciprocally increased ( Figure 4 B,C). Taken together, these data suggest that Wntless regulates lipogenic gene expression through the expression of ChREBP, C/EBP a, and SREBP1c mRNA and proteins, with SREBP1c also potentially regulated at the post-translational level. Previous studies have established i nsulin as an important regulator ofSrebf1 gene expression in the liver [ 80e83].

In response to stimuli, including insulin, Insig activity is decreased and SCAP escorts SREBP1 from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, where it is cleaved in to a soluble and transcriptionally active form [ 86,87]. We therefore explored whether SCAP mRNA or protein expression is altered by Wls deletion but found both to be unchanged in Wls-/-adipocytes ( Figure 4 G,H). Taken together, these data support the conclusion that i n adipocytes, Wntless regulates SREBP1c and ChREBP through mechanisms independent of insulin responsivity. 3.5. Adipose-speci ﬁc Wntless deletion does not in ﬂuence body composition or whole-body metabolism in mice on NCD Our studies have thus far demonstrated that Wntless expression ispromoted by diet-induced obesity, and Wntless de ﬁciency sup- presses a network of lipogenic genes and DNL and reduces fatty acid monounsaturation of adipocyte lipids. Thus, we hypothesizedthat Wntless plays an important role in vivo in the appropriate storage of circulating nutrients, particularly under obesogenic con- ditions. To test this hypothesis, we generated adipose-speci ﬁcWlsknockout mice by crossing Wls ﬂ/ﬂmice with adiponectin-Cre mice. Adiponectin-Cre has been established as a model to delete ﬂoxed genes speci ﬁcally and ef ﬁciently in adipocytes [ 88]. In our model, genetic recombination of Wlsis only observed in adipose depots, and not in other tissues, such as the liver, pancreas, and muscle (Figure 5 A). As expected, we found that Wntless mRNA ( Figure 5 B) and protein ( Figure 5 C) are decreased in iWAT and eWAT of Wls-/- mice on NCD. Analyses of mRNA from fractionated WAT demon- strated that Wls deletion occurs speci ﬁcally in the adipocyte fraction and not in the SVF of iWAT and eWAT depots ( Figure 5 D).

For example, FABP4- or OCN-Wnt10b mice have extensive trabeculation throughout the entire endocortical compartment [ 15,16]. We therefore evaluated whether marrow cells traced by adiponectin-Cre are a critical source of Wnts inthe bone marrow niche [ 89,90]. Histological analyses of tibias from both male and female cohorts suggest that Wntless de ﬁciency does not inﬂuence the size or number of marrow adipocytes ( Supplemental Figure 5A ). In addition, micro-computed tomography ( mCT) analyses indicate that cortical and trabecular bone mass variables are not inﬂuenced by Wls deletion ( Supplemental Figure 5B eI). Since Wntless was found to regulate lipogenic gene expression in vitro , we next measured the expression of a subset of key DNL genes in eWAT and iWAT of Wlsﬂ/ﬂand Wls-/-mice. As expected, Wls gene expression is signi ﬁcantly decreased in both the eWAT and iWAT of Wls-/-mice ( Figure 6 B). Surprisingly, expression of most DNL pathway genes is not changed, with the exception of Mlxipl (Figure 6 B). We also did not observe changes in DNL gene expression within the livers ofWls -/-mice ( Supplemental Figure 6A ). Analyses of isolated adipocytes from the Wls-/-mice showed that, despite ef ﬁcient knockout of Wls, theexpression of lipogenic genes is not altered ( Figure 6 C). This result was puzzling, so we next evaluated whether Wnt signaling is active withinadipose tissues in vivo. To this end, we measured the expression of downstream Wnt target genes in isolated adipocytes and the SVF of Wls -/-mice and their Wlsﬂ/ﬂcounterparts, and found that expression of Axin2 and Id2is dysregulated as expected in adipocytes with Wntless deﬁciency.

To this end, we measured the mRNA expression of many Wnts in the SVF isolated fromWls ﬂ/ﬂorWls-/-mice fed NCD and found signi ﬁcantly increased expression of several Wnts, including Wnt6 ,Wnt9b ,Wnt10a ,Wnt10b , and Wnt16 (Figure 6 E).

We also found that the Wlsexpression is up-regulated within both subcutaneous and visceral WAT with diet-induced obesity(Figure 1 E, F, and Supplemental Figure 1A ).

Analyses of the adipocyte fraction showed that Wnt target gene expression issigni ﬁcantly decreased ( Figure 8 C), suggesting that HFD challenge diminishes the ability of WAT to maintain Wnt signaling homeostasis. Consistent with this result, the expression of several lipogenic genes,including Mlxipl ,Acaca ,Fasn ,Scd1 ,a n d Elovl7 , is coordinately regulated in isolated epididymal adipocytes ( Figure 8 D,E) and whole eWAT of Wls -/-mice ( Figure 8 F), in line with our studies in cultured adipocytes ( Figures 3 and 4 ). A subset of these genes is also r e p r e s s e di ni W A To f Wls-/-mice ( Figure 8 F). To determine whether reduced WAT DNL is compensated for elsewhere, we isolated livers from the Wls-/-mice and found that they do not have altered DNL gene expression ( Supplemental Figure 7E ). In summary, our studies support the conclusion that with chr onic overnutrition, adipose tis- sues of Wls-/-mice no longer defend Wnt signaling homeostasis, which leads to down-regulation of DNL enzyme expression, reduced adipocyte hypertrophy and adiposity, and overall improved metabolic health. 4. DISCUSSION Extensive reports in the literature have characterized the mechanisms by which Wnt signaling in MSCs represses adipogenesis and promotes alternative cell fates, such as", "completion": ""}
{"prompt": "osteoblastogenesis [ 5,12,17,18,91]. TheWnts expressed in MSCs that function cell-autonomously include Wnt10b, Wnt10a, Wnt6, and other family members may conceivably participate as paracrine regulators [ 5,6,12]. The preponderance of evidence indicates that canonical Wnt/ b-catenin signaling dominates control of MSC fate, with lesser contributions from the non-canonical pathway [ 5,91]. In this regard, the expression of b-catenin is sup- pressed during adipogenesis in both mouse and human models and itsactivity is further inhibited by induced expression of Wnt antagonistChibby [ 92]. Much of the early data in this ﬁeld focused on the inhi- bition of adipogenesis by Wnt signaling, and coordinate suppression of many genes involved in Wnt/ b-catenin signaling during the early stages of differentiation. However, this study and other recently pub- lished reports demonstrate that repression of the canonical Wnt pathway during differentiation is transient, and that proteins including b-catenin, Wntless, and Tcf7l2, play important functional roles in mature adipocytes [ 32,34]. In this study, we report that essentially all aspects of the canonical Wntsignaling apparatus are expressed in mature adipocytes, including Wntless, Wnts, Fzd receptors, LRP co-receptors, Dishevelleds, b- catenin, TCF/LEFs, and modulatory proteins such as Axin2, SFRP4, andSFRP5. Indeed, Wnt signaling in cultured adipocytes is likely to havecontributions from many Wnt proteins, including Wnt16, Wnt2, and Wnt7b, which are expressed at similar levels in MSCs and adipocytes, and Wnt2b, Wnt4, Wnt5b, Wnt8b, Wnt9a, and Wnt9b, which areinduced during adipogenesis. These Wnts are proposed to act through LRP5 and LRP6 [ 9,10], in conjunction with Fzd4 and Fzd9, which also Figure 8: Wls-/-mice on HFD have reduced epididymal adipocyte size and decreased DNL gene expression .(A) Representative histological images of H&E-stained tissues from Wlsﬂ/ﬂandWls-/-mice f 60% HFD for 24 weeks; 200 /C2magni ﬁcation; scale bar, 100 mm.

We also observed induction of previ- ously reported downstream Wnt targets WISP1 and WISP2, secreted adipokines that increase with obesity and are proposed to regulate whole-body insulin sensitivity [ 93,94]. In some cases, there may also be interspecies differences that will be important for our long-term understanding of these complex processes [ 95]. We showed that the core Wnt/ b-catenin signaling molecules are expressed and operative within mature adipocytes, and expect that the unique combination of Wnts, receptors, and transcription factors provides distinct functional speci ﬁcity; however, the cellular processes in adipocytes controlled by this pathway were previously poorly understood. To evaluate the cell-autonomous functions of Wnt signaling in adipo- cytes, we blocked the secretion of adipocyte-derived Wnts throughdeletion of the Wnt chaperone protein, Wntless. As expected, Wntlessdeletion and presumed impairment of Wnt secretion from cultured adipocytes suppressed the accumulation of free cytosolic b-catenin and subsequent expression of several classic Wnt target genes, suchasAxin2 ,Tcf7l2 , and Cmyc , responses that have been observed in many other cell types. In the context of adipocytes, we observed that Wnt secretion is also required for coordinate expression of lipogenicgenes, including Acly,Acaca ,Fasn , and Scd1 . Consistent with", "completion": ""}
{"prompt": "repression of these genes, Wls -/-adipocytes exhibit functional im- pairments in DNL and lipid monounsaturation. These effects onadipocyte metabolism are highly speci ﬁc: Wntless deletion does not inﬂuence insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, adrenergic stimulation of lipolysis, or b-oxidation ( Supplemental Figure 3C eE). These data are supported by Geoghegan et al. , who reported that Tcf7l2 deletion in mesenchymal progenitors promotes adipogenesis and elevated expression of gene clusters involved in fatty acid and TAG metabolism [34], consistent with the repressive role of b-catenin and TCF/LEF signaling in this context [ 5]. Further, Tcf7l2 binding sites were reported within 1 kb of the transcriptional start site of most lipogenic genes, including Acly,Fasn ,and Scd1 , consistent with Wnt/ b-catenin signaling directly coordinating adipocyte lipid metabolism [ 34]. A common feature of Wnt signaling in a wide range of cell types and animal models is inhibitory feedback, which provides an intricate re-straint on Wnt-dependent gene activation [ 96,97]. Our lab previously observed Wnt1-induced feedback on members of the Wnt pathway in preadipocytes [ 98]; in this study, we uncovered a similar response to recombinant Wnt3a treatment of fully differentiated adipocytes. Thus,exogenous Wnt3a stimulates many of the classic inhibitory responses to limit the effects of Wnt signaling. These include induction of known feedback genes, such as Nkd1 ,Nkd2 ,Axin2 ,Notum ,Lgr5 , and Tcf7, coincident with repression of Tcf7l2 ,Fzd8 , and Lrp5 . Because Wnt secretion and functionality is largely dependent on lipid modi ﬁcation by SCD1-derived palmitoleic acid [ 41], inhibition of SCD1 results in reduced Wnt/ b-catenin signaling, an observation extensively investi- gated in the cancer ﬁeld [54e61]. In this study, we determined that the reciprocal relationship also holds true: endogenous Wnt signaling inadipocytes is required for lipogenesis and monounsaturation of lipids,including the formation of palmitoleic acid. Although", "completion": ""}
{"prompt": "signaling down- stream of adipocyte Wnts is necessary for the maintenance of lipogenic genes and production of palmitoleic acid, stimulation of adipocyteswith exogenous Wnt3a does not further promote the expression of these genes. These results may indicate that endogenous Wnt signaling plays a permissive role in the expression of lipogenic genesor perhaps that stimulation with a Wnt ligand other than Wnt3a may be necessary to observe dynamic regulation of this gene network.In mice maintained on NCD, adipocyte-speci ﬁcWls deletion does not overtly in ﬂuence body composition or whole-body metabolism. Consistent with our results, recent investigations into the role of Wnt signaling in mature adipocytes, including global deletion of Sfrp5 or adipocyte-speci ﬁc deletion of Ctnnb1 orTcf7l2 , also did not yield metabolic phenotypes on a chow diet [ 32e34]. Although these pre- vious studies did not further probe into a lack of detectable pheno-types, our experiments uncovered a novel compensatory mechanism by which adipose tissues defend the loss of adipocyte-derived Wnt signaling in mice fed NCD. We found that despite ef ﬁcient Wntless ablation at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels, adipocytes isolated from Wls -/-mice do not have altered Wnt target or DNL gene expression. However, upon further investigation, we observed that SVF cells iso-lated from Wls -/-mice upregulate Wnt mRNAs, including Wnt6 ,Wnt9b , Wnt10a ,Wnt10b , and Wnt16 . Consistent with these data, we also found elevated Wnt target gene expression in Wls-/-SVCs, as evi- denced by increased expression of Cmyc ,Tcf7l2 , and Ppard . These data suggest the intriguing possibility that under standard nutritional conditions, SVF cell populations sense the loss of adipocyte-derived Wnts and respond by up-regulating their own Wnt production andsignaling to maintain downstream target gene expression within adipocytes.

However, ﬂow cytometry analyses of immune, endothelial, and stromal cell pro-portions in the SVF did not yield observable differences between Wls ﬂ/ﬂ and Wls-/-mice, making this possibility less likely. Alternatively, a particular cell type in the SVF may detect the loss of Wnt signaling fromadipocytes and compensate by increasing its own Wnt production and secretion. It is also possible that the intricate intracellular feedback mechanisms previously described may involve other families ofsecreted signaling molecules, including BMPs and FGFs, both of which are regulated in adipocytes by Wnt3a and have been shown in other contexts to interact with Wnt/ b-catenin signaling [ 99e102]. Wnts are low-abundance, lipid-modi ﬁed proteins that act locally in an autocrine/ paracrine manner; these characteristics create major technical chal- lenges for isolating and quantifying Wnts from the tissue or serum of Wlsﬂ/ﬂandWls-/-mice. Nevertheless, further studies will be necessary to fully elucidate the compensatory mechanisms by which speci ﬁc SVF cells sense and respond to the loss of adipocyte-derived Wnt secretion. Adipose tissues are critical for the maintenance of insulin sensitivityand glucose homeostasis through storage of excess energy and secretion of adipokines [ 63,103e106]. To date, the inhibition of adipose-speci ﬁc Wnt signaling has been shown to in ﬂuence whole- body glucose homeostasis under obesogenic conditions; however, discordant results have been reported between animal models that should, ostensibly, all be loss-of-function for Wnt signaling. Forexample, our work with Wls -/-mice found that more than 20 weeks of HFD overrides the compensatory Wnt signaling in adipose SVCs, revealing a striking phenotype.

Indeed, Geogheghan et al. reported that Tcf7l2 deletion repressed the expression of lipolytic genes, possibly contributing to adipocyte hy- pertrophy and subsequent metabolic dysfunction on HFD. In any case,the results from both groups indicate that Wnt signaling regulates lipid metabolism in adipocytes. In a gain-of-function Wnt signaling model, global Sfrp5 Q27Stopmice fed HFD are characterized by decreased adipocyte size and WAT mass, elevated mitochondrial variables including oxygen consumption, and a mild improvement in glucose homeostasis [ 33]. These effects of SFRP5 on glucose homeostasis are largely supported by the injectionof SFRP5 neutralizing antibody [ 112]. Consistent with these data, transgenic mice with enforced expression of Wnt10b from the FABP4 promoter have less WAT when maintained on NCD, are resistant toHFD-induced or genetic obesity, and are more glucose tolerant and insulin sensitive than controls [ 13,14]. Taken together, these gain-of- function models support the hypothesis that increased adipose Wntsignaling in ﬂuences whole-body glucose homeostasis; however, further research is required to establish mechanisms and to resolve differences in experimental outcomes.In summary, we demonstrated that Wnt/ b-catenin signaling is active in adipocytes and adipocyte-derived Wnts are required for the expression of a network of lipogenic genes. Further, adipocytes compensate forWnt de ﬁciency through cell-autonomous mechanisms, and WAT de- fends the loss of adipocyte-derived Wnts by upregulating Wnt signaling in SVCs.

However, emerging genetic evidence in humans links a number of Wnt pathway members tobody fat distribution, obesity, and metabolic dysfunction, suggesting that this pathway also functions in adipocytes. Recent studies in mice have uncovered compelling evidence that the Wnt signaling pathway plays important roles in adipocyte metabolism, particularly under obesogenic conditions. However, complexities in Wnt signaling and differences in experimental models and approaches have thus far limited our under-standing of its speci ﬁc roles in this context. Methods: To investigate roles of the canonical Wnt pathway in the regulation of adipocyte metabolism, we generated adipocyte-speci ﬁc b- catenin ( b-cat) knockout mouse and cultured cell models. We used RNA sequencing, ChIP sequencing, and molecular approaches to assess expression of Wnt targets and lipogenic genes. We then used functional assays to evaluate effects of b-catenin de ﬁciency on adipocyte metabolism, including lipid and carbohydrate handling. In mice maintained on normal chow and high-fat diets, we assessed the cellular and functional consequences of adipocyte-speci ﬁcb-catenin deletion on adipose tissues and systemic metabolism. Results: We report that in adipocytes, the canonical Wnt/ b-catenin pathway regulates de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and fatty acid mono- unsaturation.

INTRODUCTION Canonical Wnt/ b-catenin signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway with well-established and diverse roles in cell proliferationand differentiation [ 1,2]. Binding of canonical Wnts to their membrane- spanning frizzled receptors and low-density lipoprotein receptor- related protein (LRP) co-receptors activates a complex intracellularsignaling cascade that results in the stabilization and accumulation of free cytosolic b-catenin [ 3,4].b-catenin can then translocate to the nucleus to bind to and coactivate DNA-binding T-cell factor/lymphoidenhancer-binding factor (TCF/LEF) proteins, thereby regulating Wnt target gene transcription [ 2,5,6]. Wnt signaling through the b-catenin-dependent pathway has been shown to have profound effects on mesenchymal cell fate determi-nation and differentiation. Although this pathway is also involved in myogenesis and chondrogenesis [ 7e9], its differential regulatory roles in adipogenesis and osteogenesis have been particularly well-studied.Indeed,", "completion": ""}
{"prompt": "stabilization of canonical signaling by enforced expression of Wnt3a, Wnt6, Wnt10a, Wnt10b, or a b-catenin stable mutant in multipotent progenitor cells inhibits adipogenesis and promotesosteoblastogenesis [ 10e14]. Further, activation of canonical Wnt signaling in preadipocytes by enforced expression of Wnt1, Wnt10b, or a dominant-stable form of b-catenin, or pharmacological inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3, blocks adipogenesis by suppressing in- duction of the master adipogenic transcription factors PPAR gand C/ EBPa[15e17]. In contrast, knockdown experiments in preadipocytes demonstrate that of the 19 Wnts, endogenous expression of Wnt6,Wnt10a, and Wnt10b contributes signi ﬁcantly to inhibition of adipo- genesis [ 10]. Further, treatment of preadipocytes with soluble Wnt inhibitors sFRP1 or sFRP2 or overexpression of negative regulators ofthe canonical pathway, such as Axin or dominant-negative TCF4, re- sults in spontaneous adipogenic differentiation [ 18,19]. Enforced expression of the b-catenin antagonist Chibby induces adipogenesis, whereas loss of Chibby upregulates b-catenin transcriptional activity and inhibits adipogenic differentiation [ 20,21]. Taken together, this signi ﬁcant body of work demonstrates that endogenous Wnt/ b-catenin signaling is a critical repressor of adipocyte differentiation.Although Wnt signaling is an important regulator of adipose tissue development [ 22,23], increasing genetic evidence also links this pathway to adiposity, body fat distribution, and metabolic dysfunctionin humans. For example, missense variations in canonical WNT10B correlate with increased risk of type 2 diabetes [ 24], whereas poly- morphisms in the Wnt inhibitor SFRP5 locus are associated with decreased adiposity in men [ 25]. In addition, common variants in RSPO3 and ZNRF3 have been implicated in increased waist-to-hip ratios [ 26e28]. Patients harboring loss-of-function mutations in Wnt co-receptors LRP5 and LRP6 are more likely to suffer from impaired glucose homeostasis, coronary disease, and", "completion": ""}
{"prompt": "osteoporosis [ 29,30]; in contrast, gain-of-function mutations in LRP5 are associated with increased adiposity and osteosclerosis [ 31]. Nonsense mutations in LGR4 , a protein involved in stability of the Wnt co-receptor complex, correlate with reduced adiposity and impaired bone formation and remodeling [ 32], whereas patients with gain-of-function LGR4 muta- tions are predisposed to increased visceral adiposity [ 33]. Perhaps most striking, genome-wide association studies across a broad range of ethnic populations have strongly linked polymorphisms in the ca-nonical Wnt transcriptional activator TCF7L2 to increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes [ 34e36]. Additionally, during the course of our work, Chen et al. reported novel gain-of-function mutations in CTNNB1( b-catenin) that are associated with altered body fat distribution and predisposition to obesity [ 37]. These studies provide compelling ge- netic evidence for distinct roles of canonical Wnt/ b-catenin signaling in body fat distribution and systemic metabolism.Many recent studies in mice have investigated Wnt signaling in mature adipocytes, but its functional roles in this context remain unclear. For example, enforced expression of Wnt10b from the FABP4 promoter orstabilization of Wnt signaling through global deletion of the Wnt in- hibitor secreted frizzled-related protein 5 (SFRP5) provides protection from diet-induced obesity [ 22,23,38]. In contrast, adipocyte-speci ﬁc Tcf7l2 deletion in obese mice results in increased adipocyte hyper- trophy and impaired glucose homeostasis [ 39]. Our lab has demon- strated that loss of Wntless, and thus signaling by adipocyte-derivedWnts, protects mice from diet-induced obesity and metabolicdysfunction [ 40]. Consistent with these ﬁndings, Chen et al. recently reported that b-catenin knockout mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity and exhibit improved glucose homeostasis and insulin sensi-tivity compared to control counterparts [ 37]. Taken together, these reports demonstrate that Wnt signaling plays an", "completion": ""}

However,additional studies are required to unravel the detailed mechanisms by which different Wnt pathway members contribute to metabolic function of terminally-differentiated cells. To this end, we investigated the rolesof b-catenin, the central protein in the canonical Wnt pathway, spe- ciﬁcally in adipocytes. Herein, we report for the ﬁrst time that b-catenin is a key regulator of adipocyte de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and fatty acid desaturation. Although chow-fed adipocyte-speci ﬁcb-catenin knockout mice do not exhibit an overt phenotype, deeper investigation reveals a striking phenomenon in which surrounding stromal-vascular cells (SVC)dramatically upregulate b-catenin production and return mRNA and/or protein back to de ﬁcient adipocytes, such that knockout cells have sustained expression of b-catenin despite complete genomic deletion. Thus, Wnt signaling within and between cell types is monitored in white adipose tissue (WAT), and loss of b-catenin in adipocytes is compensated for by CD45-/CD31-stromal cells to maintain whole- tissue Wnt pathway homeostasis under standard nutritional condi-tions. This compensatory mechanism is overridden by diet-induced obesity such that high-fat diet (HFD)-fed adipocyte-speci ﬁc b-cat- enin knockout mice exhibit decreased adiposity and improved glucosehomeostasis and hepatosteatosis. These ﬁndings underscore the critical importance of the canonical Wnt/ b-catenin pathway in adipo- cyte lipid metabolism and adipose tissue function. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1.

RESULTS 3.1. b-catenin is highly expressed in terminally differentiated adipocytes and upregulated by obesity The canonical Wnt/ b-catenin pathway is a critical regulator of mesenchymal cell fate determination and an endogenous inhibitor ofadipogenesis [ 15,16]. Although Wnt signaling is commonly believed to be most important in precursors, recent studies have begun to shed light on contributions of this pathway to functions within terminally-differentiated adipocytes [ 37e40]; however, speci ﬁc roles of b-cat- enin in this context require further investigation. We thus ﬁrst conﬁrmed that b-catenin is expressed in mature adipocytes. Ctnnb1 (b-catenin) mRNA and protein expression is high in cultured mesen- chymal stem cells (MSC) derived from wild-type C57BL/6J mice, transiently suppressed during differentiation, and subsequently increased in terminally-differentiated adipocytes ( Figure 1 AeB).

{"prompt": "preadipocyte marker Dlk1 (Pref1) decreases as expected ( Figure 1 AeB). To determine b-catenin levels in adipose tissues in vivo , we performed immunoblotting analyses of various tissues isolated from wild-type mice and found that b-catenin is widely expressed, including in diverse adipose depots, pancreas, and lung ( Supplemental Figure 1A ).In addition to adipocytes, WAT is comprised of many other cell types, including endothelial, immune, and stromal cells and preadipocytes. These non-adipocyte cells are known as the stromal-vascular fraction (SVF) of WAT, and previous studies have demonstrated that b-catenin is widely expressed in many of these populations [ 15,16,50e53]. To assess whether adipocyte-speci ﬁc expression contributes signi ﬁcantly tob-catenin levels within whole adipose tissues, we measured Ctnnb1 mRNA expression in fractionated epididymal (eWAT) and inguinal (iWAT) WAT of wild-type mice. We found that Ctnnb1 is highly expressed in isolated adipocytes compared to the SVF ( Figure 1 C), consistent with recently reported data [ 37]. As expected, Adipoq expression is found exclusively in the adipocyte fractions, whereas Dlk1 expression is limited to the SVF ( Supplemental Figure 1B ), providing evidence of clean separation.Recent studies have demonstrated that Wnt signaling plays a role in adipocyte metabolism under obesogenic conditions [ 37e40]. Thus, we examined the regulation of b-catenin in WAT after a number of nutritional and environmental treatments and found that its expression is upregulated in both eWAT and iWAT with diet-induced obesity (Figure 1 D), parallel with induction of Lep (leptin) ( Supplemental Figure 1C ). Consistent with Ctnnb1 expression patterns, downstream Wnt target Nkd1 increases in eWAT with HFD treatment; effects in iWAT are not statistically different ( Supplemental Figure 1D ). Further, analyses of fractionated WAT demonstrate that upregulation of Ctnnb1 largely occurs in adipocytes, rather than in the SVF ( Figure 1 E).

Finally, we searched the GTEx database to determine the distribution of Ctnnb1 gene expression across male and female human tissues and found that b- catenin is highly expressed in subcutaneous and visceral WAT depots, with relatively low expression in the liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas ( Supplemental Figure 1F ). Together, these data demonstrate thatb-catenin is expressed in mature adipocytes and up-regulated by diet-induced obesity, and thus conceivably plays an important meta- bolic role in these cells. 3.2. Canonical Wnt signaling is operative in cultured adipocytes To assess the molecular functions of b-catenin in adipocytes, we used a cultured cell model using MSCs isolated directly from b-catﬂ/ﬂmice. To ef ﬁciently ablate b-catenin in either preadipocytes or adipocytes, we established a gene deletion protocol using adenoviral Cre recom- binase ( Supplemental Figure 1G ). To induce gene deletion in pre- adipocytes, b-catﬂ/ﬂMSCs at 30 e40% con ﬂuence were infected in serum-free medium with adenoviral GFP as a control or adenoviral Cre to induce recombination. Preadipocytes were allowed to recoverfollowing infection and were analyzed at con ﬂuence. To induce gene deletion in adipocytes, b-catﬂ/ﬂMSCs were differentiated using a standard adipogenic cocktail and on day four of differentiation, adi-pocytes were infected with adenoviral GFP or Cre in serum-free me-dium. The cells were then allowed to recover and were subsequently analyzed on day 12 of differentiation. A 3-primer PCR system was used to con ﬁrm recombination of the ﬂoxed allele ( Figure 1 F, preadipocytes shown in Supplemental Figure 1H ). Efﬁcient deletion of both Ctnnb1 mRNA ( Figure 1 G) and protein ( Figure 1 H, preadipocytes shown in Supplemental Figure 1H ) were observed in Cre-infected adipocytes.

Importantly, protein levels of AXIN2 and WISP2, two known Wnt targets, decreased in b-cat/C0//C0adipocytes ( Figure 1 H, preadipocytes shown in Supplemental Figure 1H ). Thus, we next investigated in more detail whether Wnt target genes arealtered in adipocytes lacking b-catenin. To this end, we measured the expression of downstream genes under basal conditions and after stimulation with the small molecule CHIR99021, which stabilizes b- catenin through inhibition of GSK3 activity [ 15]. We found that known Wnt-induced genes, including Axin2 ,Nkd1 , and Tcf7l2 , were down-regulated in b-cat/C0//C0adipocytes, whereas Wnt-repressed genes Id2 and Wif1 were up-regulated ( Figure 1 K,Supplemental Figure 1I ). Importantly, Wnt pathway stimulation with CHIR99021 induced expression of most target genes only in b-catﬂ/ﬂadipocytes and not in b-cat/C0//C0cells, suggesting that the expression of these genes is b-catenin-dependent in terminally-differentiated cells (Figure 1 K,Supplemental Figure 1I ). Of note, Id2expression was down-regulated in both control and knockout adipocytes withCHIR99021 treatment, albeit to different degrees, suggesting that it is also regulated by other cellular pathways affected by GSK3 inhibition (Figure 1 K). Taken together, these data indicate that the canonical Wnt signaling pathway is operative in mature adipocytes and likely regu- lates functions that are specialized to these cells. 3.3. b-catenin regulates metabolic pathways in adipocytes and exclusively mediates effects of canonical Wnt3a signaling Although b-catenin-dependent canonical Wnt signaling is a critical regulator of mesenchymal cell fate, the role of this pathway in matureadipocytes is less clear. To identify transcriptional pathways directly regulated by b-catenin in terminally-differentiated cells, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses of b-catﬂ/ﬂandb-cat/C0//C0adi- pocytes at baseline and following 4 h of treatment with recombinant Wnt3a ( Figure 2 A,E).

We then used GSEA to identify signi ﬁcantly up- and down-regulated pathways in knockout cells. Strikingly, the majority of up-regulated pathways were related to theinﬂammatory response, including TNF a, IL6, interferon g, and inter- feronasignaling; in contrast, loss of b-catenin led to the suppression of several metabolic pathways, including those involved in glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid, cholesterol, and bile acidmetabolism ( Figure 2 B). Of note, mTORC1 signaling was also signi ﬁ- cantly down-regulated in b-cat/C0//C0adipocytes, which is of interest since this pathway has been shown to regulate lipid metabolism inadipocytes [ 54e57]. Wnt3a treatment of b-catﬂ/ﬂadipocytes resulted in signi ﬁcant up- regulation of 535 genes and down-regulation of 417 genes, includingdramatic induction of known Wnt targets Axin2 ,Nkd1 ,Nkd2 , and Wnt11 (Figure 2 A,C). Consistent with canonical Wnt/ b-catenin signaling predominating in adipocytes, Wnt3a treatment of b-cat/C0//C0 adipocytes only altered expression of one gene, Gpr161 , which has no known function ( Figure 2 D). As expected, treatment of control adipo- cytes with Wnt3a stimulated the expression of genes known to be related to Wnt/ b-catenin signaling ( Figure 2 B). Hedgehog and TGF b signaling, which have broad effects on differentiation and mature cell functions, were also up-regulated ( Figure 2 B); cross-talk between these pathways and Wnt signaling has been reported in other contexts[58,59]. Differential regulation of a subset of Wnt target genes was conﬁrmed by qPCR analyses of control and knockout adipocytes treated with Wnt3a for different lengths of time ( Figure 2 F). Consistent with extensive reports describing the role of Wnt signalingin precursors, RNA-seq analyses of b-catﬂ/ﬂandb-cat/C0//C0preadipocytes identi ﬁed 866 up-regulated genes and 936 down- regulated genes ( Supplemental", "completion": ""}
{"prompt": "Figure 2A and E ). Deletion of b-catenin in precursors suppressed many pathways critical for cell function, including DNA repair, proliferation, stress response, and glycolysis(Supplemental Figure 2B ), consistent with known roles of Wnt signaling in cell proliferation and cancer metabolism [ 60]. Similar to observations in control adipocytes, Wnt3a treatment of b-catﬂ/ﬂpre- adipocytes promoted the expression of many genes related to TGF b, Hedgehog, and Notch signaling ( Supplemental Figure 2A-C ). Unlike in b-cat/C0//C0adipocytes, Wnt3a treatment of b-cat/C0//C0preadipocytes resulted in up regulation of 146 genes and down-regulation of 171 genes, including induction of Wnt target genes such as Axin2 andNkd1 (Supplemental Figure 2D-F ). These data indicate that in preadipocytes, Wnt target genes are also regulated by non-canonical Wnt signalingpathways, whereas in adipocytes, Wnt3a acts exclusively through a b- catenin-dependent mechanism. 3.4.b-catenin-dependent signaling regulates lipogenesis and fatty acid desaturation in adipocytes Lipogenesis and lipid accumulation are two specialized functions ofadipocytes. Thus, we were intrigued to ﬁnd that the RNA-seq dataset identi ﬁed many genes related to lipid metabolism, including Srebf1 and Scd1 , as signi ﬁcantly down-regulated in b-cat/C0//C0adipocytes (Figure 3 AeB).

DNL converts excess dietary amino acids and carbohydrates into fatty acids, a subset of which can be esteri ﬁed into TAG and later mobilized to provide energy to adipocytes and other cells throughout the body [ 61,62].

Because SCD1 protein expression was suppressed by w55% in b-cat/C0//C0adipocytes ( Figure 3 D, Supplemental Figure 3A ), we hypothesized that TAG isolated from these cells would have decreased unsaturated fatty acids andincreased saturated fatty acids. Indeed, we found that b-cat/C0//C0ad- ipocytes contained a smaller proportion of monounsaturated fatty acid species compared to control adipocytes ( Figure 3 E). Closer examina- tion revealed that compared to b-catﬂ/ﬂadipocytes, lipids isolated from terminally differentiated b-cat/C0//C0cells contained signi ﬁcantly higher proportions of palmitic (16:0) and stearic (18:0) acids and lessmyristoleic (14:1, n-5) and palmitoleic (16:1, n-7) acids ( Figure 3 F, Supplemental Figure 3B ).

Although it is surprising that Elovl6 did not follow the expression pattern of other ChREBP- and SREBP1-regulated lipogenic genes, increased Elovl7 has been observed in various contexts of repressed Wnt signaling [ 40,66e68].

Differentiated adipocytes were incubated in me- dium containing [14C]-acetate for 2, 4, or 8 h. Cells were then lysed and lipids extracted to measure incorporation of radiolabel into TAG,diacylglycerol (DAG), and phospholipid (PL) fractions. Conditioned media ( Supplemental Figure 3C ) and whole cell lysate ( Supplemental Figure 3D ) analyses indicated that b-cat/C0//C0adipocytes took up less labeled acetate over time. Consistent with this, both Slc16a1 (Mct1 ), an acetate transporter, and Acss2 , the cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes activation of acetate for use in lipid synthesis, were suppressed in b- cat/C0//C0adipocytes ( Supplemental Figure 3B, E ).b-cat/C0//C0adipocytes incorporated signi ﬁcantly less radiolabel over time into the TAG and DAG fractions of cellular lipid ( Figure 3", "completion": ""}
{"prompt": "G,Supplemental Figure 3F ), but not the PL fraction ( Supplemental Figure 3G ). This is important, as it suggests that acetate uptake is not the rate-limiting factor for radio- label incorporation into TAG; indeed, decreased acetate incorporation in lipid synthesis may actually feedback to suppress transporterexpression. Further, linear regression analyses demonstrated that decreased incorporation into TAG was not proportional to decreased acetate uptake ( Supplemental Figure 3H-I ), strongly suggesting that suppressed expression of DNL enzymes, not genes related to acetate transport or activation, is rate-limiting for lipogenesis in b-cat/C0//C0 adipocytes. Thus, impaired DNL is secondary to loss of b-catenin- dependent Wnt signaling. These data suggest that adipocyte b-catenin signaling is required for lipogenic gene expression, DNL, and steady- state lipid composition. 3.5.b-catenin exerts effects on lipogenesis through transcriptional regulation of Srebf1 and Mlxipl Extensive liver studies have identi ﬁed SREBP1c and ChREBP as key upstream transcriptional regulators of many genes involved in DNL, including Acaca ,Fasn , and Scd1 [69,70]. We recently demonstrated for the ﬁrst time that Wnt signaling mediates adipocyte lipogenic gene expression through regulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) [ 40]. Thus, we next investigated whether these genes are speci ﬁcally regulated by b-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling. Indeed, we found that the expression of Srebf1 and Mlxipl , which encode SREBP1c and ChREBP, respectively, were both repressed in b- cat/C0//C0adipocytes; other transcription factors involved in adipogenesis and mature adipocyte function, including Pparg and Cebpa , were not altered ( Figure 3 AeB, H).

Asb-catenin coactivates TCF/LEF proteins such as Tcf7l2 (Tcf4) to mediate transcription of downstream targets, we analyzed the pro- moter regions of Mlxipl ,Srebf1 ,Acaca ,Fasn , and Scd1 and found multiple predicted Tcf7l2 binding sites on each gene (data not shown).Thus, we interrogated a recently published chromatinimmunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) dataset of Tcf7l2 binding in cultured Tcf7l2 ﬂ/ﬂand Tcf7l2/C0//C0adipocytes [ 39] and found enrichment of Tcf7l2 binding sites in the promoter, exon, and/or ﬁrst intronic regions of Mlxipl ,Srebf1 ,Fasn , and Scd1 ; binding occupancy of Tcf7l2 was subsequently lost in the Tcf7l2/C0//C0cells ( Figure 3 K). Taken together, these results support a model in which repressive effects of b-catenin deletion on lipogenic gene expression are medi- ated, in part, through down-regulation of ChREBP and SREBP1c. However, identi ﬁcation of Tcf7l2 binding sites in transcriptional reg- ulatory regions of several lipogenic genes, including Acaca ,Fasn , and Scd1 , suggests that b-catenin regulates transcription of these genes directly through co-activation of TCF/LEF transcription factors and indirectly through expression of the lipogenic transcription factorsChREBP and SREBP1c. 3.6.

Genetic recombination was speci ﬁcally observed in various adipose depots, but not in other tissues, including the liver, muscle, pancreas, lung, or heart ( Figure 4 A).

We also did not observe changes in DNL gene expression within livers of the b-cat/C0//C0 mice ( Supplemental Figure 6C ). Perhaps most perplexing, analyses of isolated adipocytes from b-cat/C0//C0mice did not demonstrate altered DNL gene expression, except for mild suppression of Scd1 (Supplemental Figure 6D ). These data were concerning and suggested that perhaps b-catenin was not ef ﬁciently deleted in vivo . Indeed, we were surprised to ﬁnd that although b-catenin appeared to be recombined at the genomic level in whole WAT of b-cat/C0//C0mice (Figure 5 A), suppression of Ctnnb1 mRNA was much less substantial than expected ( Figure 5 B). Further, b-catenin protein levels were virtually unaltered in eWAT and iWAT of b-cat/C0//C0mice ( Figure 5 C). As SVF cell populations are known to express b-catenin, we consid- ered the possibility that adipocyte-speci ﬁc loss was being masked by the relatively high expression of b-catenin in SVCs. Thus, we frac- tionated WAT to determine whether ef ﬁcient deletion occurred within adipocytes. Indeed, we found that b-catenin gene recombination occurred speci ﬁcally in adipocytes and not SVCs of b-cat/C0//C0mice (Figure 5 D). However, we were surprised to ﬁnd that Ctnnb1 mRNA was reduced by only w50% in the adipocyte fraction of b-cat/C0//C0 mice, and its expression was highly induced in the SVF of knockout mice ( Figure 5 E). We also observed sustained levels of b-catenin protein in knockout adipocytes and signi ﬁcant induction of b-catenin protein within the SVF of b-cat/C0//C0mice ( Figure 5 F).", "completion": ""}

These striking ﬁndings suggest that adipose tissues can sense depletion of b-catenin and subsequently maintain canonical Wnt signaling across the tissue by up-regulating the pathway in SVCs.Thus, we next evaluated whether a speci ﬁc cellular sub-population was enriched within the SVF of b-cat/C0//C0mice and found that several macrophage markers, including Adgre1 (F4/80 ),Cd68 , and Cd11c , were elevated, whereas markers for endothelial and stromal cells did not change ( Supplemental Figure 6E ). These data may sug- gest that macrophage numbers were increased in the SVF of b-cat/C0//C0 mice; these macrophages may in turn have contributed Ctnnb1 mRNA orb-catenin protein back to de ﬁcient adipocytes, either directly via small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) or indirectly by stimulating pro- duction in neighboring cells. Although macrophage markers wereincreased, expression of classical in ﬂammatory markers were either decreased or unchanged in whole WAT of b-cat/C0//C0mice (Supplemental Figure 6F ).

Consistent with Ctnnb1 expression pat- terns, downstream Wnt targets Axin2 and Nkd1 were also increased in the CD45-/CD31-cells isolated from b-cat/C0//C0mice ( Supplemental Figure 6H ). These data suggest that a sub-population of CD45-/CD31- stromal cells is able to sense the loss of adipocyte b-catenin, either directly or indirectly, and subsequently up-regulate its own expressionto maintain Wnt signaling homeostasis within WAT of chow-fed mice.

Upon harvest, weights of iWAT, eWAT, and pWAT were signi ﬁcantly decreased in knockout mice, consistent with leaner body composition, whereas BAT, liver, and pancreas weights were unchanged ( Figure 6 K,Supplemental Figure 7C ). His- tological analyses of b-cat/C0//C0tissues suggested that adipocyte sizes within iWAT and eWAT were mildly decreased ( Figure 6 L). In addition, livers of knockout mice had less hepatosteatosis compared to control counterparts ( Figure 6 L), in line with recently reported ﬁndings [ 37].

Further, analysis of the adipocyte fraction demonstrated decreased expression of Wnt targets, including Axin2 ,Nkd1 ,Wnt10b , and Wnt16 (Figure 7 E). Consistent with our in vitro studies showing the effects of b-catenin deletion on DNL, adipocytes of HFD-fed knockout mice were also characterized by decreased expression of key lipogenic genes, including Srebf1 ,Mlxipl ,Acly,Acaca ,Fasn , and Scd1 (Figure 7 F). We also found that macrophage markers were decreased in the SVF of HFD-fed knockout mice ( Figure 7 G), corroborating results reported by Chen et al.

Consistentwith decreased immune cell markers, whole WAT of b-cat/C0//C0mice had suppressed expression of some in ﬂammatory markers, including Tnfa and Inos2 (Figure 7 HeI). Expression of Saa3 , which encodes a secreted protein that activates macrophages, was also decreased in WAT of HFD-fed knockout mice ( Figure 7 HeI). Thus, taken together, ourﬁndings demonstrate that diet-induced obesity overrides stromal compensation for adipocyte-speci ﬁcb-catenin deletion, leading to impaired lipogenic gene expression, decreased adipose accumulation and adipocyte hypertrophy, and protection from metabolicdysfunction. 4.

The preponderance of data within adipocyte biology to date has focused on the inhibition of adipogenesis by Wnt signaling, undoubtedly because many genes involved in this pathway are sup-pressed during the early stages of differentiation [ 73]. However, our work herein and recently published studies from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that canonical Wnt pathway members arepresent and operative in terminally-differentiated adipocytes and thushave distinct functional roles in this context [ 37e40]. To evaluate speci ﬁc roles of canonical Wnt signaling in adipocyte function, we ablated b-catenin, the central protein in the pathway. b-catenin deletion in cultured adipocytes suppressed expression of known downstream target genes, including Axin2 ,Nkd1 ,a n d Tcf7l2 . Further, stimulation of Wnt signaling using either a GSK3 inhibitor or recombinant Wnt3a was largely blocked in adipocytes lacking b-catenin, suggesting that effects of canonical Wnt signaling are mediated exclusively by b-catenin in terminally- differentiated cells. Global RNA-seq analyses of b-catﬂ/ﬂandb- cat/C0//C0adipocytes identi ﬁed several metabolic pathways as down- regulated by inhibition of Wnt signaling, including oxidative phos-phorylation, glycolysis, and fatty acid, cholesterol, and bile acidmetabolism. Of particular intere st to adipocyte biology, we found that signaling through b-catenin is required for the coordinate expression of many lipogenic genes, including Acly,Acaca ,Fasn , and Scd1. Of note, RNA-seq analyses of livers from b-cat/C0//C0mice also demonstrate decreased expression of lipogenic genes, including Acly and Scd1 [74]. Consistent with repressed expression of DNL enzymes, b-cat/C0//C0 adipocytes were characterized by impaired lipogenesis and fatty acid monounsaturation.

These data are strongly supported by recently published work from our group showing that blocking secretion and downstream signaling of adipocyte-derivedWnts also inhibits DNL and lipid unsaturation [ 40]. Additionally, Geo- ghegan et al. recently reported that Tcf7l2 deletion in precursor cells stimulates adipogenesis and increased expression of genes related tolipid metabolism, providing further support for the presumptive role of b-catenin-dependent signaling in regulation of this process in adipo- cytes [ 39]. Extensive studies in the liver have identi ﬁedSrebf1 and Mlxipl , encoding SREBP1c and ChREBP, respectively, as key upstream transcriptional regulators of DNL enzymes [ 62]. In this study, we report that the expression of Srebf1 and Mlxipl was signi ﬁcantly decreased in b-cat/C0//C0adipocytes, and that ectopic expression of ChREBP or SREBP1c partially rescued expression of DNL genes in adipocytes lacking b-catenin. These data are consistent with genome-wide ChIP-seq analysis of ChREBP binding sites in WAT, which identi ﬁed binding sites on many genes related to metabolism, including Acaca ,Fasn , and Scd1 [75]. Thus, b-catenin mediates effects on DNL genes in part by regulating the expression of key transcription factors Srebf1 and Mlxipl . Indeed, ChIP-seq analyses of Tcf7l2 binding sites in cultured adipocytes, used as a surrogate for b- catenin/TCF/LEF activity, identi ﬁed speci ﬁc Tcf7l2 occupancies in regions surrounding the transcriptional start sites of Mlxipl and Srebf1 , but also downstream lipogenic genes such as Fasn andScd1 . Although these data suggest that b-catenin regulates transcription of lipogenic genes through a combination of indirect (via ChREBP and SREBP1c) and direct mechanisms, ChIP-seq analyses of b-catenin binding sites in adipocytes will be required to further elucidate thedirect versus indirect effects of b-catenin on transcription of lipogenic genes.

Indeed, consistent with our studies, recent investigations into roles of Wnt signaling in mature adipocytes, including global Sfrp5 deletion or adipocyte-speci ﬁc deletion of Tcf7l2 ,Wntless ,o r Ctnnb1 , also did not reveal an overt metabolic phenotype in chow-fed mice [ 37e40]. However, we recently published a study showing that surrounding SVCs compensate for the loss of adipocyte-derived Wnts secondary to Wntless deletion [ 40]. Thus, we probed further into the lack of a detectable phenotype in b- cat/C0//C0mice and were surprised to ﬁnd that although b-catenin was efﬁciently ablated at the genomic level in knockout adipocytes, the mRNA and protein were still detectable at much higher levels than expected. These data are consistent with those recently published by Chen et al., who reported a w50% reduction in b-catenin mRNA expression in adipocytes isolated from iWAT or eWAT of knockout mice [37]. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the substantial b-catenin expres- sion remaining, we found that Wnt targets and lipogenic genes werenot altered in isolated knockout adipocytes. However, further investi-gation revealed that SVCs isolated from b-cat/C0//C0mice exhibited signi ﬁcantly up-regulated expression of Ctnnb1 and downstream Wnt targets, including Axin2 ,Nkd1 ,Tcf7l2 ,Wnt10b , and Wnt16 . Although Chen et al. did not report elevated Ctnnb1 expression in the SVF of knockout mice, their data suggest a trend toward increased expression in SVF isolated from eWAT [ 37]. These data support the compelling conclusion that Wnt signaling is critical for autocrine and paracrine communication within WAT, such that loss of Wnt/ b-catenin signaling in adipocytes is sensed and compensated for by SVCs to maintainwhole-tissue Wnt signaling homeostasis.Original Article 16MOLECULAR METABOLISM 42 (2020) 101078 /C2112020 The Author(s).

Gene expression analysis of CD45þ, CD31þ, and CD45-/CD31-populations isolated by FACS demonstrated that Ctnnb1 and downstream targets Axin2 andNkd1 are signi ﬁcantly upregulated in CD45-/CD31-stromal cells of knockout mice. These data suggest that a sub-population of CD45-/CD31-cells, which include adipose stem cells, committed preadipocytes, and pericytes [ 76], is able to directly or indirectly sense the loss of adipocyte b-catenin and sub- sequently up-regulates its own expression to maintain Wnt signalinghomeostasis within WAT of chow-fed mice. This compensatory mechanism may be the result of a dynamic network of intercellular Wnt signals; alternatively, it may conceivably arise from complex in-teractions between canonical Wnt signaling and other pathways,including Hedgehog, BMP, and FGF signaling [ 58,77,78]. Gene expression analysis of whole SVF indicated that several macro- phage markers, including F4/80 ,Cd68 , and Cd11c , were increased in chow-fed b-cat/C0//C0mice. Of note, various isoforms of CD45 are present on almost all differentiated hematopoietic cells, and although Cd68 and Cd11c are commonly used as macrophage markers, they are also expressed by non-hematopoietic cell types, including endo- thelial and stromal cells [ 79,80]. Thus, it is possible that b-catenin indeed causes a mild increase in macrophage number, but that thisdifference is not observed when using a broad marker such as CD45, which stains virtually all hematopoietic cells. Further studies using single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of SVF from b-catﬂ/ﬂandb-cat/C0/ /C0mice may help clarify speci ﬁc sub-population changes following adipocyte-speci ﬁc loss of b-catenin.

Recently, Crewe et al. found that endothelial-derived sEVs mediate cross-talk between adipocyte and SVF cell populations [ 88]. Indeed, they reported a phenomenon strikingly similar to the one weobserved in chow-fed b-cat/C0//C0mice: despite ef ﬁcient genetic ablation of Cav1 (caveolin-1), cav1 protein was readily detectable in deﬁcient adipocytes. Ultimately, this was found to be the result of sEV-mediated traf ﬁcking of cav1 protein from surrounding endo- thelial cells back to Cav1/C0//C0adipocytes. In addition to cav1, pro- teomic analysis of isolated endothelial sEVs identi ﬁed members of the Wnt signaling pathway, including b-catenin [ 88]. Thus, a similar mechanism may explain the sustained expression of b-catenin protein in knockout adipocytes. In addition to identi ﬁcation of the cell population contributing elevated b-catenin expression, further studies are required to determine whether b-catenin protein is trafﬁcked back to de ﬁcient adipocytes. To date, studies of Wnt signaling in mature adipocytes have consis-tently reported that metabolic phenotypes are revealed with long-termHFD. However, con ﬂicting results have emerged: our work in b-cat/C0//C0 mice fed HFD demonstrated decreased weight gain and fat mass, signi ﬁcantly", "completion": ""}
{"prompt": "improved glucose homeostasis, decreased circulating TAG and glucose-stimulated insulin release, and protection from hep-atosteatosis. Of note, the metabolic effects observed in our mice were remarkably consistent with data recently reported by Chen et al.; in their study deleting b-catenin from adipocytes, obese b-cat/C0//C0mice also exhibited decreased body weight and adiposity, accompanied by improved glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and hepatosteatosis [37]. Additionally, adipocyte-speci ﬁcWntless/C0//C0mice fed HFD were also characterized by decreased fat mass and protection from glucose intolerance and hepatosteatosis [ 40]. In contrast, HFD-fed Tcf7l2/C0//C0 mice demonstrated increased WAT mass, impaired glucose tolerance, and insulin insensitivity [ 39]. Further, WAT isolated from Tcf7l2 knockout mice had elevated lipogenic gene expression, including Scd1 . There are many potential reasons for these discordant results, including the generation of alternative Tcf7l2 splice variants [ 90], compensatory activity of other TCF/LEF transcription factors [ 18,19], or downstream effects on signaling pathways independent of b-catenin [91]. Nevertheless, it is clear from these studies that Wnt signaling within adipocytes, while complex, plays a critical role in the regulation of lipid metabolism. One ﬁnal point of interest is the functional protection from diet- induced obesity and subsequent metabolic dysfunction that loss of adipocyte-speci ﬁcb-catenin signaling appears to afford mice. Chen et al. found that WAT of HFD-fed b-cat/C0//C0mice contained fewer PDGFR aþpreadipocytes, indicating that reduced fat mass is caused by decreased hyperplasia [ 37]. Further, they observed decreased expression of Saa3, a secreted protein that is elevated with obesity and type 2 diabetes and functions to activate macrophages to pro-mote local in ﬂammatory responses [ 92e94]. Chen et al. proposed the hypothesis that reduced Saa3 in HFD-fed b-cat/C0//C0mice leads to less macrophage recruitment and activation and subsequently", "completion": ""}
{"prompt": "lessPDGFR aþcell proliferation. Indeed, global Saa3-de ﬁcient mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity, adipose tissue in ﬂammation, and dyslipidemia [ 95]. Our studies demonstrated that consistent with macrophage marker expression patterns, Saa3 was mildly higher in b-cat/C0//C0mice maintained on chow diet and was subsequently suppressed in knockout mice with HFD feeding. Thus, it is possible thatb-catenin mediates cross-talk between mature adipocytes and surrounding cells through Saa3, but future studies are required to directly answer this question. In summary, we report that b-catenin-dependent canonical Wnt signaling regulates various metabolic pathways in mature adipo- cytes, including lipid metabolism. Indeed, b-catenin is required for coordinate regulation of DNL and fatty acid desaturation, partlymediated through the key transcription factors Srebf1 and Mlxipl . Perhaps most interestingly, in chow-fed mice, CD45 -/CD31-stromal cells respond to adipocyte-speci ﬁcb-catenin depletion by up- regulating b-catenin and downstream target gene expression to defend canonical Wnt signaling homeostasis within WAT. We contend that this compensatory m echanism may explain the lack of observable phenotypes under standard nutritional conditions invirtually all mouse models that have been developed to interrogate the function of Wnt signaling in adipocytes. Finally, HFD feeding obesity overrides this compensatory mechanism, revealing that b- cat/C0//C0mice are protected from diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction. Together, these novel ﬁndings underscore the critical importance of Wnt signaling in regulation of glucose and lipidmetabolism in mature adipocytes.

Abstract Laboratory mice are a crucial preclinical model system for investigating BMAd-bone and BMAd­ hematopoiesis interactions. In this review, we evaluate the suitability of mice to model common human diseases related to osteopenia or hematopoietic disorders, pointing out consistencies and discrepancies among different studies, and provide insights into model selection. Species, age, sex, skeletal site, and treatment protocol should all be considered when designing future studies. Keywords bone marrow adipose tissue; bone marrow adipocyte; preclinical models; bone; hematopoiesis Bone marrow adipocytes (BMAd) are a unique cell population existing within the bone marrow cavity. Although these cells were discovered over a century ago, they were largely neglected until recent decades. BMAds are no longer considered a mere space filler of the bone marrow but are now recognized as a heterogeneous cellular population that make up a distinct adipose depot and interact with surrounding bone and hematopoietic cells [1]. Due to the anatomically closed bone system and limited approaches to specifically manipulate genes or metabolism in BMAds, the regulatory mechanisms and physiological functions of BMAds remain incompletely understood. Current experimental approaches targeting BMAds also modulate adipocytes elsewhere in the body or alter gene expression in osteoblasts and marrow stromal cells. These limitations create difficulties in interpreting studies designed to investigate interactions between BMAds and bone or hematopoietic cells. In addition, the inherent differences between species may limit translation of findings from certain animal models to human physiology and", "completion": ""}

Imaging methods used for in vivo and ex vivo marrow adiposity evaluation Before we discuss the physiology of BMAds, however, a brief discussion of current methods for visualizing and quantifying bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) in humans and mice is warranted. BMAT can be evaluated non-invasively using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT)-based imaging technologies [ 2]. MRI-based quantitative techniques, such as water-fat imaging and 1H-MRS have advantages in assessing BMAT content and composition without ionizing radiation. Water-fat imaging is especially useful in red marrow, where BMAds are scattered with hematopoietic cells, such as in pelvis,", "completion": ""}

However, MRI is less informative than CT for assessment of trabecular bone features [ 4]. Conventional CT integrates the density of calcified tissue with marrow components, and increased marrow fat influences the accuracy of bone mineral density (BMD) determination [5]. Dual-energy CT can be used to assess BMAT content and BMD in a single examination and provides BMAT data that closely correlate with 1H-MRS [ 6]. Suchacki et al. recently developed a method for visualization and quantification of human BMAT from CT data. To do so, they compared paired MRI and CT scans to identify the optimal Hounsfield Units (HU) thresholds to distinguish BMAT from red marrow and bone. With this novel method, they quantified site- and age-dependent differences in red marrow and BMAT in humans [ 7]. For isolated mouse bones, MRI has been used to overview the marrow fat content [ 8], whereas μCT is a more quantitative and accurate approach to evaluate BMAT volume in bones stained with osmium tetroxide after decalcification [ 9]. Moreover, Scheller et al. established nanoCT as a more precise way to quantify BMAd number and size in proximal tibia where isolated BMAds are found interspersed within regions of active hematopoiesis [ 10]. Of note, one of the pitfalls of osmium tetroxide staining is that it interacts with unsaturated bonds of fatty acids, which means that it endows the electron density to lipid droplets depending on lipid composition [ 11]. With biopsy or autopsy bone samples from patients or mice, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histological sections are a convenient, less expensive way to evaluate bone marrow hematopoietic cellularity and adiposity.

Using these methods allows for quantification of BMAds in both in vivo and ex vivo studies. Comparison of bone marrow adiposity between humans and mice In humans, accumulation of BMAds to replace red hematopoietic marrow begins in terminal phalanges of feet and hands just prior to birth. Shortly after birth, further expansion of BMAT in long bones occurs distally to proximally and is more prevalent at distal sites. Li and MacDougald Page 2 Best Pract Res Clin Endocrinol Metab . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 July 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptBMAT is readily detected in distal epiphyses of long bones by age seven and in the midshaft around 12–14 years old [ 13]. The adult distribution is first observed at about 25 years, with BMAT occupying approximately 50%–70% of the total bone marrow cavity, with at least some BMAds also present in vertebrae, sternum, ribs and pelvis [ 9, 13]. In lumbar vertebrae, marrow adiposity expands with age varying from 27% to 70% in individuals between 8 and 57 years of age, respectively [ 14]. Accumulation of BMAT with age is also influenced by sex. Female subjects younger than 55 years have approximately 6–10% lower marrow fat than age-matched males [ 15], whilst the sharp increase of BMAT in postmenopausal women drives about 10% higher marrow fat content than males at ages over 60 years [ 16]. Expansion of total BMAT volume with age is due to increased BMAd numbers and size - diameters of BMAd are ~65 mm at 82–96 years of age, compared to ~48 mm at ages of 16–29 years in Caucasians [ 17]. Mice are widely used in preclinical studies with advantages being their metabolic similarity to humans, shorter time of development, and ease of genetic modification. Although mice have lower bone marrow adiposity than humans, the timing and sequence in marrow BMAd development are similar. For instance, ~20% and ~60% of tibial BM cavity is", "completion": ""}

Caudal vertebrae of mice develop BMAds as early as one week after birth and are nearly fully developed at four weeks of age (Figure 1). BMAds may also be found in sacrum and lower lumbar vertebral bodies in adults, but it is rare to see BMAds in cervical and thoracic vertebrae. Only a few BMAds are visible in distal tibia one week after birth. Distal tibial BMAds are readily detectable at four weeks and continue to accumulate until the cavity is filled at around eight weeks (Figure 1) [ 10]. BMAT in femur and proximal tibia appears later than caudal vertebrae and distal tibia, but is detectable at four weeks or even earlier depending on sex and strain. Female mice usually develop BMAT earlier and more-extensively in proximal tibia than age-matched males [ 10, 18]. C57BL/6J mice have been widely used in metabolic research; however, their long bones are characterized by low trabecular and cortical bone densities, and fewer BMAds. In contrast, C3H/HeJ mice have both higher bone density and more marrow adiposity than C57BL/6J mice [ 10]. As first characterized by Tavassoli [ 19] and extended by our group, BMAds can be broadly classified into two groups. BMAds that are interspersed in hematopoietic cells are labile or regulated (rBMAds), and can be lost in response to phenylhydrazine-induced hemolysis, fasting, lactation, bariatric surgery, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and chronic central leptin administration. This population is readily expanded in response to aging, obesity, caloric restriction, ovariectomy, irradiation and thiazolidinedione treatment. In contrast, stable or constitutive BMAds (cBMAds), which appear early in life, are densely packed and have an appearance indistinguishable from white adipose tissue (WAT). As suggested by their nomenclature, cBMAds are largely not influenced by the variables above, although recent work has shown", "completion": ""}

Because rBMAds exist proximally to commonly analyzed bone regions and can be altered by myriad physological and phathological conditions, most preclinical models have focused on the changes in rBMAds, which are found in proximal tibia, distal femur and axial skeleton.Li and MacDougald Page 3 Best Pract Res Clin Endocrinol Metab . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 July 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptAnimal models for investigation of BMAT functions in bone homeostasis The physical location of BMAds adjacent to osteoblasts/osteoclasts has led many to speculate that BMAT influences development of bone diseases. The tenet of BMAd-bone interaction is supported by many clinical studies that marrow fat content is inversely related to trabecular BMD, microstructure variables and ex vivo failure load [ 20]. Although this relationship has been observed in a wide variety of animal models, there remains a lack of direct evidence for a causal relationship. Age is a complex factor for interactions between BMAds and bone. Distinct from the continual increase of BMAT in humans throughout life, BMD and bone mineral content (BMC) peak around 30 years of age [ 16, 21] and then decline with age. Therefore, BMAT expansion occurs concurrently with bone mass accrual in children and young individuals [ 22] but expansion is associated with bone loss after 30 years of age. It is important to note, however, that cross-sectional studies demonstrate an inverse relationship between BMD and BMAT at all ages [ 23–26]. In rodents, rBMAT increases until at least 56 weeks of age [ 10]. How bone variables are influenced by age is dependent on site and type of bone. For example, cortical bone generally reaches maximum mineral density and thickness at 24 weeks of age, whereas age of maximal trabecular bone number and volume varies between six and 24 weeks, depending on strain and location [ 27, 28]. Trabecular bone is thus not", "completion": ""}
{"prompt": "an ideal choice for age-associated bone studies. Of note, most BMAd-bone interaction studies were performed when mice were younger than 24 weeks, a time in which both BMAT and bone are still developing. Overall, the development of BMAT throughout life and loss of bone mass with aging are largely consistent between humans and rodents. Although BMAT amount adversely associates with bone mass at all stages of life, whether age also plays an independent role is an open question. To address this, Almeida et al. deleted PPAR γ in BMAds to decrease baseline BMAT, and block the increase in BMAT that normally occurs with aging. However, even in the absence of BMAT, these mice still had age-related trabecular and cortical bone loss [ 29]. A caveat to this study is that the mouse model used also deleted PPAR γ in some stromal cells and osteoblasts. Further mechanistic research on how age drives BMAT expansion is required to understand the relationship to bone loss. Age is an important variable to consider in experimental design or data interpretation. High fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity poorly replicate clinical observations in bone. Human obesity increases adiposity, not only of subcutaneous and visceral depots, but also of bone marrow. Although the myriad side-effects of obesity on cardiovascular diseases, glucose and lipid disorders have been extensively studied, effects on bone are still debated. Quality of bone should ideally be determined by geometry, cortical thickness and porosity, trabecular bone morphology, and intrinsic properties of bony tissue; however, quality in clinical practice is usually estimated indirectly by BMD. Overweight/obese patients generally have higher BMD than lean individuals [ 30] due to heavier mechanical loading and lower bone turnover [ 31]. However, fracture risk differs across skeletal sites, with significant interaction between BMI and BMD.Li and MacDougald Page 4 Best Pract Res Clin Endocrinol Metab .

{"prompt": "Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptIs it possible for mice to model the complexity between obesity and bone biology observed in humans? Induction of obesity with HFD is commonly used for investigation of metabolic syndrome, and also for effects on BMAT expansion and bone metabolism. Although BMAT expansion varies from 12 to 16 weeks, it has been consistently observed in different strains. However, effects of obesity on bone is complex with considerations including age of HFD feeding, types of diet, mouse strain and sex. For example, HFD feeding for 12 weeks induces BMAT expansion and loss of trabecular bone with milder effects on cortical bones in C57BL/6J and FVB mice initially of ~8 weeks of age [ 32–34]. In contrast, if started at ~11 weeks of age, HFD feeding increases bone mass of C57BL/6J, LG/J and SM/J mice [ 35, 36]. To complicate matters further, feeding C57BL/6J with HFD for 12 weeks from 3 weeks of age causes no changes to trabecular and cortical bone [ 37]. Overall, these discrepancies between different studies suggest that investigators should be cautious about using obesity as a preclinical model to study effects of BMAT accumulation on bone metabolism. Further standardization of HFD feeding models with respect to age, diet, and strain is warranted, and may improve our ability to model complex interactions between marrow adiposity and bone. Genetic models of obesity have also been used to study relationships between BMAd and osteopenia. For example, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice have a marked increase in BMAd number. Although femora are shorter with less bone mass, trabecular bone of vertebra is increased [ 38]. Leptin administration restores femoral length, BMD and BMC in ob/ob mice, suggesting that leptin is critical for bone development [ 39]. Because leptin receptor is expressed and functional in bone marrow stromal cells, BMAds, osteoblasts and chondrocytes, the reasons underlying osteopenia in ob/ob mice are unclear. Therefore, care should be taken when considering genetic models to", "completion": ""}

In the 1970s, it was first noted that anorexia nervosa patients had BM hypoplasia with expansion and a change in character of BMAT [ 40]. This observation was built on in the 1980s with multiple groups finding that these patients also have osteoporosis/osteopenia [41, 42]. Moreover, increased marrow adiposity and bone loss are associated with elevated cortisol and other hormonal changes [ 43]. Clinical work in anorexia nervosa patients noted an inverse relationship between marrow fat content and BMD [ 44]. Anorexia nervosa is a disease in which restriction of calories is a symptom of a psychological disorder. Interestingly, caloric restriction (CR) is thought to have health benefits including reduced adiposity, improved metabolism and increased lifespan; however, a downside includes effects on bone. In non-obese younger adults randomly assigned to 25% CR or ad libitum for two years, CR significantly decreased BMD at lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck and other regional hip sites at 12 and 24 months [ 45]. The CR group also had increases in cortisol and adiponectin, but lower levels of circulating leptin and physical activity [ 45]. Obese humans over 65 who voluntarily underwent weight loss generally had reduced BMD in total hip and femoral neck, but with no change or higher BMD in L1-L4 [ 46].Li and MacDougald Page 5 Best Pract Res Clin Endocrinol Metab .

CR of male mice consistently causes loss of bone when they are actively growing through three weeks to about three months of age [", "completion": ""}
{"prompt": "8, 47]; however, there are few effects on bone in the 13–17 month range, and CR actually increases bone mass of male mice at two years of age [ 48]. In contrast, female mice have much milder bone changes despite the significant changes in BMAT after CR. Although CR causes bone loss in female mice in very young actively-growing mice, effects on bone gradually diminish with age [ 49, 50]. It is possible that estrogen contributes to differences between sexes. In both sexes, changes in body composition and hormones are shared between mouse CR and human anorexia nervosa, including lower adipose mass and leptin, and higher cortisol levels. Despite the fact that the incidence of anorexia nervosa is much higher in women, use of CR in female mice may not be a useful model for studying bone loss. However, it may be that mechanistic insights can be gained through use of younger male mice where bone loss with CR is observed. Estrogen deficiency may be an ideal model to study BMAd-bone interaction. In women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, bone loss occurs due to increased bone turnover, and is accompanied by an increase of BMAT. Bone marrow fat content is negatively associated with BMD at lumbar spine and hip [ 51]. Estrogen treatment increases bone formation markers, and inhibits bone resorption markers [ 52]. In mice, ovariectomy is classically used to study effects of estrogen deficiency. Consistent with menopause, ovariectomy causes BMAT expansion and bone loss in mice. An increase in BMAT is observed as early as four weeks after ovariectomy, although bone loss varies depending on age, bone site and strain [ 53–55]. Ovariectomy of C57BL/6J mice at eight weeks causes substantial cancellous bone loss, whereas at 12 weeks it results in only moderate bone loss and at 16 weeks bone loss is very mild [ 56]. Moreover, C57BL/6J mice have greater bone loss than BALB/c and outbred (ICR and Kunming) strains [ 56].

Ovariectomy at young age is thus a promising murine model to study mechanisms of BMAd-bone interaction during estrogen deficiency. However, Iwaniec et al. found that mice without BMAT still lost bone following ovariectomy [ 57], which suggests that under these conditions, gain of BMAT is independent of bone mass, or that estrogen plays independent roles in bone homeostasis. Further work is required to pinpoint mechanistic relationships between BMAT expansion and bone loss. Irradiation causes transient BMAT expansion and long-term bone loss. Increased fracture risk is commonly observed in cancer patients who have undergone radiotherapy, particularly with irradiation of bone. Hypocellularity is frequently present in irradiated bones and is often associated with a disproportionate accumulation of collagen and BMAT at ~6 months, which then progressively worsens [ 59, 60]. The timing and degree of reduced bone mass is variable after radiotherapy, but 12 months is often sufficient to observe a reduction of BMD and increase of fracture risk [ 61, 62].

Irradiation also causes dose-dependent loss of bone, with 1 Gy causing a 28% reduction and 2 Gy causing a ~40% decline in tibial cancellous bone volume fraction within 10 days [ 66], which persists for at least 110 days [ 67]. Rapid reduction of trabecular bone mass is due to resorption, with elevated osteoclast numbers observed at 1 to 2 weeks post-radiation therapy, followed by long-term osteoclast depletion [ 68]. In vivo studies indicate radiotherapy-induced bone loss is ameliorated in mice treated with bisphosphonates [ 69, 70]. In addition to elevated bone resorption, decreased active osteoblasts and bone formation following radiation have also been reported [ 71], which is strengthened by the observation that PTH1–34 alleviates radiotherapy-induced bone loss by preventing apoptosis of osteoblasts and osteocytes, and attenuating radiation-induced bone marrow adiposity [ 72]. Although radiation therapy in humans and rodents causes rapid BMAT expansion and bone loss, whether increased BMAT causes depletion of bone remains an open question. This reflects our limited knowledge of mechanisms for accumulation of BMAT and the function of BMAT within the marrow niche. Anti-diabetic thiazolidinediones (TZDs) stimulate BMAT accumulation and bone loss in humans and mice. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have an increased risk of fragility fractures despite normal or higher BMD. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are anti-diabetic drugs that increase insulin sensitivity by activating PPAR γ [73]. However, TZDs cause side effects including weight gain, bone loss and increased fracture risks [ 74]. Severity of TZD-induced osteoporosis is higher in women, the aged, diabetics and with longer treatments [ 74].

In addition to the specific TZD evaluated, this discrepancy may because the former study recruited diabetic adults from both sexes, whereas the latter only included healthy postmenopausal women.

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptIn rodents, treatment with rosiglitazone causes bone loss and greater marrow adiposity within four weeks [ 79, 80]. The mechanisms of TZD-induce bone loss relate to bone remodeling - TZDs decrease osteoblast function and suppress new bone formation, whilst increasing bone resorption. Aging influences the mechanisms by which TZDs cause bone loss. Young growing mice show only a mild decrease in bone formation rate. However, adult mice have significant bone loss with rosiglitazone treatment, mainly due to attenuated bone formation, whereas in aged mice, bone loss was associated with increased osteoclastogenesis [81]. In vitro studies demonstrated that activation of PPARg by TZDs promotes commitment of progenitor cells to the adipocytic lineage while inhibiting osteoblastogenesis [ 82], which may explain how these drugs decrease bone formation and increase fragility. The effects of TZDs on BMD and marrow adiposity also vary by mouse strain, which is thus an important consideration for experimental design and interpretation.

Although C3H/HeJ mice showed a significant reduction of BMD in response to rosiglitazone, less striking changes in BMAT were observed than in C57BL/6J mice. In DBA/2J and A/J mice, skeletal effects are milder compared with C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ mice [ 83]. Taken together, most animal studies indicate that TZDs expand BMAT and deplete bone. Future studies using BMAd-specific mouse model to knockout PPARg will give us more insights about whether expansion of BMAT is required for bone loss. Effects of lipodystrophy on bone and marrow adiposity depend on underlying genetic cause and often differ between humans and mice. Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) is a rare condition characterized by an almost total lack of WAT. Instead of storing fat in adipocytes, these patients store fat elsewhere in the body, including liver and muscle, which causes serious metabolic dysfunction. Four types of CGL have been described, which are distinguished by their genetic causes. Mutations in the AGPAT2, BSCL2, CA V1, and CA VIN1 genes cause CGL types 1 through 4, respectively. In addition to peripheral adipose loss, CGL1 and CGL2 patients have obvious loss of BMAT, whereas, CGL3 and CGL4 patients have well-preserved bone marrow adiposity. CGL1 and CGL2 patients are more likely to form bone cysts after puberty, which can cause individuals to be prone to spontaneous fractures. CGL4 is associated with muscle weakness, delayed development and joint abnormalities. Although CGL patients generally have bone deterioration, increased BMC and BMD have also been found [ 84, 85]. Mice deficient for AGPAT2 and BSCL2 have lipodystrophy phenotypes similar to CGL1 and CGL2, with significant loss of WAT and BMAT [ 86, 87]; however, no bone data is available on these models. Similar to CGL3 patients, knockout mice have a loss of WAT yet retain normal BMAT content and", "completion": ""}

Corresponding to loss of rBMAT, an increase of trabecular bone was observed in proximal tibia [ 10]. Other transgenic mouse models of congenital or acquired lipodystrophy have been created, including A-ZIP/F-1 (AZIP) [ 89], adiponectin-driven PPAR γ, kindlin-2 or LMNA knockout [ 90, 91] (Corsa et al.-under revision), and DTA expressing model [ 92]. These models consistently show loss of WAT and BMAT, and increased bone mass and formation or even osteopetrosis, which supports the common observation that BMAT negatively correlates with bone mass. Due to inconsistency in evaluation of bone parameters in lipodystrophy patients and animal studies, further studies are required to establish suitability of specific mouse models for preclinical studies. Moreover, the global metabolic disorders of lipodystrophy patients and mice make mechanistic interpretations of effects on bone challenging. Animal models used for studying BMAd-hematopoiesis interactions In adults, ~70% of bone marrow is filled with BMAT, which means that hematopoietic cellularity in 30% of bone marrow volume is responsible for generation of red blood cells and the majority of lymphocytes. Clinical work in premenopausal women demonstrate an inverse relationship between BMAT and circulating red and white blood cells [ 93]. Further, estrogen treatment of anorexia nervosa resulted in a reduction of BMAT and an increase in white and red blood cells [ 93].

{"prompt": "lineage and are closely associated with erythroblast islands [ 94]. A single BMAd interacts with more than 100 hematopoietic cells through direct cell-cell contact and indirect signals [ 94]. Our own studies demonstrate that myeloid cell expansion induced by G-CSF administration depletes BMAT dramatically [ 95], suggesting that BMAds may serve as energy sources during hematopoietic cell proliferation. However, work in a variety of preclinical models suggests that debates about whether BMAT plays beneficial or detrimental roles in hematopoiesis are far from over. Aging increases BMAT and alters hematopoietic cell fate determination in humans and rodents. Bone marrow cellularity declines with aging of humans and mice, although hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) numbers increase [ 96]. Generally, HSCs in young humans and animals are quiescent and serve as a reservoir for long-term storage; however, aged HSCs have a higher rate of cell division and proliferation [ 97]. HSCs differentiate into myeloid progenitor cells and lymphoid progenitor cells. In humans, hematopoietic changes with aging include declines in lymphopoiesis [ 98], and increases in frequency of myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative disorders, and myeloid malignancies [ 99]. HSCs from the elderly exhibit more myeloid-biased differentiation potential, and do not engraft or generate lymphoid progeny as efficiently in xenotransplanted-immunodeficient mice [ 97]. In aged mice, BMAT accumulation is accompanied by a decrease in B-lineage progenitor cells [ 100], and HSCs are more likely to differentiate into myeloid progenitors [ 101]. Because effects of age on BMAT and hematopoiesis are largely shared between humans and mice, the interactions between these cellular populations can be studied in mice as a preclinical model.Li and MacDougald Page 9 Best Pract Res Clin Endocrinol Metab .

{"prompt": "following irradiation. As discussed above, irradiation causes a rapid accumulation of BMAT, which is accompanied by a decrease of hematopoietic cellularity within three days, followed by a gradual and near total recovery of hematopoiesis by 28 days in mice [ 102]. Irradiation of A-ZIP/F1 mice, which are devoid of all adipocytes including BMAds, demonstrated that in long bones, BMAds are important for HSC maintenance and hematopoietic regeneration by secreting stem cell factor [ 65]. In contrast, BMAds negatively regulate HSC frequency and hematopoietic regeneration in adipocyte-enriched caudal vertebrae [65]. These observations suggest that interactions between BMAd and hematopoietic cellularity may differ between sites. Most irradiation studies are followed by bone marrow transplantation. Using this approach, Naveiras et al. found that marrow engraftment is accelerated after irradiation in fatless A-ZIP/F1 mice and PPAR γ inhibitor-treated mice [89]. Consistent with this approach, co-transplantation of HSCs with bone marrow-derived preadipocytes greatly impaired hematopoiesis [ 103]. Again, further investigation is required to establish mechanisms and functions of BMAT expansion after irradiation. It is likely that BMAds play roles in hematopoietic regeneration by secreting adipokines/cytokines and/or changing the microenvironment of bone marrow. Hematological malignancy models may be valuable to explore the relationship between BMAds and malignant cell proliferation/survival. Human epidemiological data show that obesity, which correlates positively with higher bone marrow adiposity, is associated with an increased risk of developing leukemia and relapse [ 104, 105]. These data suggest that adipose tissue plays a direct or indirect role in development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and multiple myeloma (MM). For AML, it has been demonstrated that BMAds within and immediately surrounding the tumor", "completion": ""}

The extensive proliferation of leukemic blasts in the bone marrow reduces size of adipocytes by activating lipolysis, with transfer of fatty acids from adipocytes to AML blasts [ 106]. Importantly, presence of small BMAd predict poor prognoses of AML patients [ 107]. Obese adults diagnosed with ALL have a 50% higher likelihood of relapse than lean adults. ALL cell injection into obese mice does not affect the time to develop leukemia, but the chemotherapy efficacy is impaired in diet-induced obese mice [ 108]. MM is typically a disease of the elderly with a median age of diagnosis of 65 years. As discussed, BMAT gradually accumulates in bone marrow cavities as part of the aging process. It is likely that functional interactions between BMAds and MM cells exist. In vitro studies demonstrated that adipocytes support the proliferation and migration of MM cells whereas they inhibit MM cell apoptosis [ 109]. Although the preponderance of studies support the idea that BMAT provides a suitable microenvironment for tumor growth and protects tumor cells from treatments, activation of PPAR γ rescued healthy hematopoietic output and repressed leukemic growth in both patients [ 110] and mice [111]. These studies cannot exclude the possibility that PPAR γ agonists may directly affect leukemic cells per se , rather than working through BMAds. Overall, it appears that BMAds play an active role in generation of a metabolic niche suitable for maintenance of malignant Li and MacDougald Page 10 Best Pract Res Clin Endocrinol Metab .

{"prompt": "TZD treatment, and lipodystrophy generally share the inverse relationship between BMAT and bone found in humans and mice. Of these, aging, estrogen deficiency, irradiation, and TZD treatment appear to be particularly good preclinical models, whereas caution should be exercised for effects of obesity and lipodystrophy. The relationship between BMAT and hematopoiesis with aging, irradiation and malignancy can also be modeled adequately in preclinical models, although much less work has been performed in this area. Discrepancies between preclinical models and humans can be minimized in some cases by careful choice of species, sex, age, strain, site-specificity and treatment protocol. Understanding mechanistic relationships between BMAT and either bone or hematopoietic cells remains in its infancy, and requires more sophisticated animal models to investigate functional interactions between BMAd and cells of the marrow niche.

Here, we developed the brownadipocyte CRISPR (BAd-CRISPR) methodology to rapidlyinterrogate the function of one or multiple genes. With BAd-CRISPR, an adeno-associated virus (AAV8) expressing a sin-gle guide RNA (sgRNA) is administered directly to BAT of miceexpressing Cas9 in brown adipocytes.

Other molecularadaptations predict additional cellular inef ﬁciencies with an increase in both protein synthesis and turnover, and mitochondria with reduced reliance on mitochondrial-encoded gene expression and increased expression ofnuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes. These data suggest thatBAd-CRISPR is an ef ﬁcient tool to speed discoveries in adipose tissue biology. Adipose tissues play important physiological roles in the maintenance of whole-body energy homeostasis and meta-bolism. Beyond simply storing excess energy in the form oftriacylglycerols, adipose tissues are found throughout the bodyin distinct depots, each with unique functions. Classically, adipose tissues are categorized as white (WAT), which arefound in subcutaneous and visceral depots, or brown (BAT), which are found in the interscapular, periaortic, perirenal, paravertebral, and intercostal depots ( 1,2). Beige/BRITE adi- pocytes, a distinct adipocyte population induced by coldexposure and adrenergic agonists, are found within a subset ofWAT depots ( 3). Adipose tissues are also located in more specialized areas, such as in the bone marrow, intramuscular,periarticular, pericardial, epicardial, retro-orbital, and dermaldepots ( 1,4,5). Collectively, these tissues comprise the largest endocrine organ in the body and regulate satiety, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, bone homeostasis, blood pressure, andthe immune response ( 6,7). Thus, investigation of adipose tissues is integral to our understanding of their roles inmetabolic disorders such as obesity or lipodystrophy ( 8). Research on adipose tissues has relied heavily on transgenic mouse models. Conditional models using the Cre/LoxP systemhave enabled tissue-speci ﬁc knockouts to study genes of in- terest.

In addition, inducible transgenic models including Adipoq-Cre ERT, Ucp1-CreERT, and “AdipoChaser ”have afforded control over the timing of gene knockout ( 9,10,12,13). Although these transgenic mouse models have led to tremendous advances in our un- derstanding of adipose tissue development and physiology, they are not without limitations. For example, Adipoq-Crecauses recombination in some osteoblasts, whereas Fabp4-Cre causes widespread recombination due to early expres-sion in development ( 9,11,14,15). Moreover, tamoxifen administration to Cre ERTmice has been shown to decrease food intake and adipose mass, and in some cases, interact withthe genetic de ﬁciency to in ﬂuence the resulting phenotype (16). Cre expression can also change from generation-to- generation in mouse colonies ( 14). Another critical limitation is that Cre mice must be bred to mice harboring a ﬂoxed allele, which necessitates the generation of a new mouse strain.Generating novel transgenic strains requires a substantial in-vestment of time and ﬁnancial resources before experiments can be performed, and knocking out multiple genes is possiblebut onerous.

An alternative strategy to modulate gene expression in vivo has centered upon the use of CRISPR/Cas9 delivery forinducible knockout in somatic tissues. CRISPR/Cas9 com-prises a Cas9 endonuclease, which creates double-strand DNAbreaks, and a single guide RNA (sgRNA), which is a pro- grammable RNA molecule that directs Cas9 to its target site for mutagenesis ( 17,18).

Viral delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 machinery for inducible gene deletionoffers several advantages over conventional germline knock-outs as the timing, tissue, and target can be closely controlled(19). Moreover, embryonically lethal genes can be studied in this context. Several iterations of viral CRISPR/Cas9 delivery have been developed ( 20). For example, both Cas9 and sgRNA have been packaged into viral vectors and administered to thelung epithelium, liver, and hippocampus ( 21–23). In addition, transgenic approaches have created inducible and tissue-speci ﬁc Cas9-expressing mouse models to which sgRNAs are delivered using adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) ( 20). Platt et al. (24) developed a Cre-dependent Cas9 knockin mouse, which when bred to mice expressing Cre enables somatic- genome editing in speci ﬁc tissues. As a proof of concept, AAVs encoding a sgRNA to Kras,p53,o rLkb1 were delivered to the lung to accurately model adenocarcinoma disease pro-gression. This Cas9 model has been further adapted forinducible somatic gene knockout in heart, skin, intestine, andthymus, thereby demonstrating its broad versatility acrossdifferent tissues ( 25,26). Although AAV-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 gene transfer has proven useful for modeling disease in numerous tissues, its usein adipose tissues has been limited. This, in part, is becauseadipose tissues are located throughout the body, makingtransduction dif ﬁcult ( 27–29). Moreover, mature adipocytes only comprise 11 to 40% of the total cell population of adiposetissues and lack unique cell-surface receptors, which make itchallenging for vectors to navigate speci ﬁcally to the adipo- cytes ( 27–29). Currently, mutagenesis by CRISPR/Cas9 has been accomplished in preadipocyte culture models and inposterior subcutaneous WAT (psWAT). For example, Shenet al.

Although these studies show that CRISPR/Cas9 can function in cultured preadipocyte models, the ﬁeld has yet to unlock the full potential of CRISPR/Cas9 for somatic gene editing in vivo . Toward that goal, the Rosen laboratory used AAV-mediatedCRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis to inducibly knockout Herc6 in inguinal WAT and suppress the expression of Herc6 mRNA in adipocytes ( 32). Although this study demonstrated that CRISPR/Cas9 can be used in adipose tissue, it did not fully characterize its application or evaluate utility in BAT. Thus, we optimized AAV-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout genes ininterscapular BAT, which is an important site of adaptive thermogenesis and uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation ( 33). BAT also secretes endocrine and local factors that stimulatethermogenesis by increasing hypertrophy, vascularization,innervation, and blood ﬂow to BAT ( 34). In humans, active BAT is inversely associated with body mass index, making it apotentially attractive target for combatting obesity ( 35). Herein, we report the use of CRISPR/Cas9 to induce gene knockout in BAT. Our methodology, termed brown adipo-cyte CRISPR (BAd-CRISPR), integrates viral delivery with theestablished Cre/LoxP approach to signi ﬁcantly decrease the time and investment required to knockout genes in the BATof adult mice.

The AAV expression vector also contains a CMV- driven mCherry ﬂuorescent marker and 5 0and 30inverted terminal repeats ( Fig. 1 A). We designed sgRNAs using the CRISPOR design tool and selected sgRNAs that targeted earlycoding regions, lacked 0- or 1-base mismatch off-target sites,and had high cutting frequency determination (CFD) scores(36). The CFD score, developed by Doench and Fusi, calculates the off-target potential of a sgRNA by considering the posi-tions and identities of mismatched nucleotides in the sgRNAsequence ( 37). As a general rule, sgRNAs should have a CFD score ≥0.2 (37). All of the sgRNAs used in the following studies had a CFD score >0.4 (Fig. S1 B).BAd-CRISPR: Inducible gene knockout in BAT of adult mice 2J. Biol. Chem.

The frameshift mutations accounted for 97.5%, 92.5%, and 95.5% of the total mutations for sgRNAs targetingAdipoq ,Atgl, and Plin1 , respectively ( Fig. 1 ,B–D). Analyzing CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutations using decomposition ofSanger sequence traces is an easy to use and cost-effectivemethod for assessing a small number of samples ( 39). TIDE and next generation sequencing analyses have been shown to be highly correlated; however, frequencies calculated using TIDE often underrepresent true editing ef ﬁciency when compared with next generation sequencing ( 40). Thus, the true editing ef ﬁciency for each sgRNA is likely higher. After validating sgRNA ef ﬁciencies in vitro , AAV-expression vectors were used to generate AAVs encoding a sgRNA and mCherryﬂuorescent marker. For transducing adipose tissues, AAV serotype 8 (AAV8) has been used most extensively owing to its favorable tropism for brown and white adipocytes ( 27,29,32, 41–46). BAd-CRISPR mice express Cas9 exclusively in BAT Although AAV8 is the gold standard for transducing adi- pose tissues, its relatively small genome size ( /C244.7 kb) limits the ability to package Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 with the sgRNA and mCherry transgene ( 27–29). Therefore, we developed a mouse line that expresses Cas9 speci ﬁcally in brown adipocytes (BAd-CRISPR) by breeding two existingmouse lines: Ucp1 promoter-Cre recombinase (B6.FVB-Tg (Ucp1-cre)1Evdr/J) and Cre-dependent Cas9-GFP (Rosa26- LSL-Cas9) ( Fig. S2 A)(10,24). As expected, Cas9 is detected by immunoblot analyses in lysates from BAT of BAd-CRISPRmice but not from psWAT, parametrial WAT (pmWAT), orliver, nor is it found in tissues from mice lacking Ucp1-Creexpression ( Fig. S2 B).

Thus, these mice are a suitable model to assess the effectiveness of CRISPR/Cas9 for inducible gene knockout speci ﬁcally in brown adipocytes. Local injection of AAV8-mCherry to interscapular BAT robustly transduces BAT with minimal leak to other tissues Next, we optimized a delivery strategy using AAV8 to administer sgRNAs for BAd-CRISPR inducible gene knockout.Initially, we attempted tail vein injection or intraperitonealinjection of 100 μl1 0 12vg/ml AAV8-mCherry to transduce all adipose tissues; however, both methods were unsuccessful andled to substantial transduction of liver. However, direct in- jection of AAV8 into adipose depots has been shown to signiﬁcantly improve transduction ef ﬁciency and reduce vector accumulation in liver, heart, and lung ( 27,29,41). To test this approach, we directly injected 100 μl1 0 12vg/ml AAV8- mCherry into interscapular BAT or psWAT and sacri ﬁced mice after 14 days in accordance with previously establishedprotocols ( 41,47). In our hands, direct injection into psWAT transduced only a minority of white adipocytes; however, direct injection of interscapular BAT showed widespread and robust mCherry expression throughout the entire depot(Fig. S3 ,Aand B). After direct injection of BAT, a small number of cells in liver were also mCherry-positive, butmCherry was not detected in examined WAT depots ( Fig. S3 , Aand B).

BAd-CRISPR enables simultaneous knockout of two or three genes in brown adipocytes To test whether BAd-CRISPR can be used to knockout multiple genes in BAT concurrently, we targeted Atgl and Plin1 using two separate AAV8 vectors. We chose Atgl and Plin1 as targets because they have opposing functions; ATGL hydrolyzes triacylglycerols, whereas PLIN1 protects againstthis hydrolysis ( 53,54). Moreover, it has been established that Atgl knockout in BAT causes hypertrophy and whitening, whereas Plin1 knockout in BAT decreases tissue size and causes a darker morphology; therefore we would have a visual phenotype with which to evaluate the feasibility of a doubleknockout ( Fig. 3 ,Aand B)(48–51). BAd-CRISPR mice and Rosa26-LSL-Cas9 mice lacking functional Cas9 (BAd-CRISPRControl) were administered 100 μl1 0 10vg/ml AAV8-sgRNA targeting Atgl alone, Plin1 alone, or Atgl andPlin1 in combi- nation.

Further, BAd-CRISPR is speci ﬁc to interscapular BAT, with loss of ATGL and UCP1 in paravertebral BAT observed inonly 1 to 2% of brown adipocytes. †Collectively, these data demonstrate that BAd-CRISPR is scalable for inducibleknockout of multiple genes in interscapular BAT. BAd-CRISPR ablates Ucp1 expression in brown adipose tissue The global Ucp1 knockout mouse model has been exten- sively studied since it was ﬁrst generated by Enerbäck et al. in 1997 ( 57). Thus, it is well known that UCP1-de ﬁcient mice (Ucp1 −/−) rely on compensatory mechanisms such as increased shivering, activation of futile cycles, or recruitment of beige/ BRITE adipocytes to maintain body temperature when cold stressed ( 58). These adaptations allow Ucp1−/−mice to tolerate a stepwise reduction in ambient temperature from thermo-neutrality ( /C2430 /C14C) to extreme cold ( −10/C14C); however, immediate cold exposure at 4/C14C can prove lethal for mice lacking functional UCP1 ( 58–61). Although a plethora of papers have reported on molecular and physiologic conse-quences of constitutive global Ucp1 knockout, whether similar effects are observed when Ucp1 is inducibly knocked out of adult animals has not been explored.

Importantly, Cas9-GFP expression was exclusive to BAT and was not detected in other examined tissues ( Fig. 5 A). We also observed an increase in mCherry mRNA expression between 0 and 14 days ( Fig. 5 B).

UCP1 knockout occurred only when Rosa26-LSL-Cas9 mice were bred to the Ucp1-Cre background and therefore had functional Cas9 expression ( Fig. S4 ,BandC). We also found that UCP1 knockout only occurred when BAd-CRISPR micewere administered AAV8- Ucp1 sgRNA and not when administered AAV8-Control sgRNA ( Fig. S4 ,Dand E). To quantify transduction ef ﬁciency, we performed immuno ﬂuo- rescent analyses on ﬁxed BAT from BAd-CRISPR Ucp1 or BAd-CRISPR control mice.

BAd-CRISPR Ucp1 inducible knockout mice defend core body temperature and have elevated circulating FGF21 Next, we used BAd-CRISPR Ucp1 mice to determine if adult mice maintain body temperature when cold stressed at 5 /C14C after inducible UCP1 knockout in BAT. Female 8- to 10-week- old mice were implanted with an intraperitoneal telemeter tomonitor core body temperature 1 week before AAV8 admin-istration. All mice were singly housed at room temperature(20–21 /C14C), and nest building materials were withheld throughout the study. We administered 100 μl1 012vg/ml AAV8- Ucp1 sgRNA or AAV8-Control sgRNA to the inter- scapular BAT (n = 4 or 5 mice) and the mice were allowed to recover for 14 days ( Fig. 6 A). The mice were then cold stressed at 5/C14C for 24 h. BAd-CRISPR induced complete loss of UCP1 expression at both the mRNA and protein level ( Fig. 6 ,Band C). Despite an apparent total knockout of UCP1 in inter- scapular BAT, there was no difference in body temperaturewhen mice were housed at room temperature (20 –21 /C14C) or cold stressed (5/C14C) (Figs. 6 ,DandEandS5A). The same is true for the aforementioned Ucp1−/−mice, which, when pre- acclimated to mild cold stress, are cold-tolerant ( 61). We did not observe changes to body weight, BAT weight, or averagedaily food intake between BAd-CRISPR control and BAd-CRISPR Ucp1 mice ( Fig. S5 ,B–D).

Interestingly, weobserved an “intermediate ”increase in serum FGF21 concen- trations in BAd-CRISPR Ucp1 inducible knockout mice compared with Ucp1 −/−and BAd-CRISPR control mice after being cold stressed at 5/C14C for 24 h ( Fig. 6 G). These data further support the role of FGF21 in adaptive thermogenesis(34,64,65). Gene pro ﬁling of BAT from BAd-CRISPR Ucp1 mice suggests peroxisomal lipid oxidation and increased protein synthesis/turnover as a compensatory thermogenic process Although thermoneutrality in mice is approximately 30 /C14C, mice are typically housed at 20 to 22/C14C and are therefore under a mild but chronic cold stress ( 55,56). To explore po- tential mechanisms by which BAd-CRISPR Ucp1 mice adapt to a moderate cold stress in the absence of UCP1, we performedRNA-Seq on BAT from mice administered 100 μl1 0 12vg/ml AAV8- Ucp1 sgRNA or AAV8-Control sgRNA.

Peroxisomal β-oxidation differs from mitochondrial β-oxidation in that peroxisomes lack a respiratory chain, and thus electrons from FADH 2are transferred to O 2to form H 2O2, and energy is released as heat (66). Thus, it is likely that in response to acute loss of UCP1 expression in interscapular BAT, adult mice have increased reliance on peroxisomal β-oxidation to maintain thermoneutrality. We also observed down-regulation of eight mitochondrial- encoded genes that encode proteins of the electron transportchain and coupled respiration, as well as the nuclear-encodedmitochondrial gene, Ndufa4I2 (Fig. 7 B). These data support work showing that UCP1-de ﬁcient BAT mitochondria exhibit dramatic reduction in proteins of the electron transport chain (67).

With nearly 40% of adults in the United States considered to be obese, more ef ﬁcient strategies to study adipose tissues are required to improve our understanding of how these tissues contribute to metabolic disease and to identify potential therapies ( 76). BAd-CRISPR inducible gene knockout distills the laborious process of generating atransgenic mouse into two basic steps: constructing an AAV8-sgRNA and administering it to interscapular BAT ofCas9-expressing mice. Our method couples the novelty ofCRISPR/Cas9 with the established Cre/LoxP system to enablehighly ef ﬁcient inducible gene knockout in BAT. Although we implemented this model for BAT using BAd-CRISPR mice, it is easily amendable to other cell types or tissues by crossing theCre-dependent Rosa26-LSL-Cas9 with other tissue-speci ﬁc promoter-driven Cre lines ( 24). Using our cloning strategy, a sgRNA can be incorporated into the AAV-expression vector,validated in vitro , used to generate any AAV serotype, and delivered to a tissue of interest. Our work has thus shown fortheﬁrst time that CRISPR/Cas9 can be harnessed to signi ﬁ- cantly improve our understanding of BAT function. We anticipate that with further optimization, this methodologywill become generally applicable to white, marrow, and otheradipose depots. We designed and validated highly ef ﬁcient sgRNAs that caused frameshift mutations in cultured cells in >92% of the total sequences. In general, we prioritized sgRNAs that tar-geted early coding regions of genes to introduce frameshift mutations and disrupt translation of mRNA. We also observed profound suppression of mRNA expression for each targetedallele, suggesting a mechanism for inhibiting gene transcrip-tion.

{"prompt": "administration of a single AAV8-sgRNA tointerscapular BAT resulted in near total knockout of Adipoq , Atgl,Fasn,Plin1 ,Scd1,o rUcp1 speci ﬁcally in brown adipo- cytes. We also demonstrated that multiple sgRNAs could be administered simultaneously using different AAV8 vectors toachieve concomitant knockout of up to three genes. Of note,we observed striking morphologic differences between BAT ofmice administered AAV8- AtglsgRNA, AAV8- Plin1 sgRNA, or a combination of the two. Ideally, future iterations of BAd-CRISPR will entail multiple sgRNAs cloned into a singleAAV expression vector. In our model, we were limited by packaging restrictions from the mCherry ﬂuorescent marker, which we included to quantify transduction ef ﬁciency. How- ever, based on our data, it is apparent that local AAV8administration to the interscapular BAT leads to robusttransduction and subsequent gene knockout. As such, themCherry marker could be replaced with multiple U6promoter-driven sgRNAs to different genomic targets. Pack-aging multiple sgRNAs into a single AAV is preferable to administering multiple AAVs to deliver single sgRNAs, as only one viral particle needs to transduce a brown adipocyte forgene knockout. Moreover, packaging sgRNA along with Cas9 into one AAV could provide an all-in-one system for induciblegene knockout. Novel Cas9 orthologs smaller than S. pyogenes Cas9 ( /C241300 aa) such as Neisseria meningitidis Cas9 (1082 aa), Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (1053 aa), Campylobacter jejuni Cas9 (984 aa), and Geobacillus stearothermophilus Cas9 (1089 aa) have all been identi ﬁed for potential use to permanently modify the genome ( 77,78). Thus, future iterations may include more compact, highly ef ﬁcient Cas9 orthologs for an all-in-one AAV system. BAd-CRISPR enabled us to generate the ﬁrst inducible UCP1 knockout model and to determine that adult knockoutmice can defend core body temperature when acutely coldstressed at 5 /C14C.

{"prompt": "sufﬁcient to impact whole body physiology through the elevation of circulating FGF21, which is known be up-regulated by Ucp1 deﬁciency and in response to cold stress (34,64,65). RNA-Seq analysis identi ﬁed dramatic changes to the transcriptome of BAT in BAd-CRISPR Ucp1 mice. We observed an increase in genes associated with peroxisomalβ-oxidation and lipid metabolism, suggesting that alternative adaptive thermogenic mechanisms are activated in response to inducible UCP1 loss in adult mice. We also found that inducible loss of UCP1 disrupted mitochondrial gene expres-sion, with reduced mitochondrial-encoded electron transportchain genes, but induction of many nuclear-encoded mito-chondrial genes. Gene pro ﬁling also suggests that thermo- genesis in the absence of UCP1 may be accomplished by afutile cycle of increased protein synthesis and turnover. It isimportant to note that UCP1 loss was exclusive to the inter- scapular BAT, which is the largest BAT depot in rodents. However, the mice also have smaller BAT depots located inthe periaortic, perirenal, paravertebral, and intercostal areas(79,80). Therefore, it is likely that UCP1-mediated adaptive thermogenesis in these intact BAT depots helps to maintainbody temperature in BAd-CRISPR Ucp1 knockout mice. Importantly, we did not detect evidence of substantial off- target mutations in vivo using unbiased whole genome sequencing and RNA-Seq analyses. It is known that the total number of mismatched base pairs is a determinant forS. pyogenes Cas9 ef ﬁciency, and that protospacer-adjacent motif-proximal mismatches are less tolerated than moredistal mismatches ( 73). Hsu et al. (73) reported that three or more mismatches eliminated Cas9 cleavage activity at mostgenomic loci. In the example of Ucp1 sgRNA, we did not observe signi ﬁcant mutations at seven off-target loci. Each of these loci contained 3 to 4 base mismatches. Although CRISPResso2 detected mutations in 1.8% of the reads at theintergenic off-target site on chromosome 18, we did not detectevidence of mutations", "completion": ""}

Although we cannot de ﬁnitively rule out off-target mutations at this site, the data suggests off-target mutationsare quite rare, and thus are not likely to in ﬂuence BAT physiology.

(2021) 297(6) 101402 13knockout in interscapular BAT, this method is not without its limitations. For instance, BAd-CRISPR permanently alters thegenome of brown adipocytes only, and thus gene expression isnot altered in stromal vascular cells even if transduced withAAV8-sgRNA. Thus, precursor cells that subsequently differ-entiate into brown adipocytes are unlikely to be mutated, andalthough adipocyte turnover in humans is estimated to be /C2410% per year, long-term studies may necessitate additional injections for sustained knockout ( 81,82). For broader appli- cation of BAd-CRISPR to brown adipocytes, stromal vascularcells, and precursor cells, the Rosa26-Cas9 knockin mouse canbe used. In this model, all the cells express Cas9-GFP; there-fore, gene knockout is enabled in all cell types within a tissue.Indeed, we have shown that local injection of AAV8 to theinterscapular BAT also leads to detectable transduction in liver, where expression of sgRNAs would be expected to cause mutations in Rosa26-Cas9 knockin mice. However, incorpo-rating microRNAs to the AAV vector can prevent transgeneexpression in off-target tissues. For example, Jimenez et al. (41) added liver and heart-speci ﬁc microRNAs to AAV8, which signi ﬁcantly reduced transgene expression in each tis- sue, respectively. Thus, several strategies can be used to modifyBAd-CRISPR for targeted gene knockout in whole tissues. We have thus shown for the ﬁrst time that CRISPR/Cas9 can be used for inducible gene knockout in BAT in vivo .

Experimental procedures sgRNA design and cloning sgRNAs were designed using CRISPOR or the Synthego CRISPR Design tool ( 36). We selected sgRNAs that targeted early coding regions, did not have 0 or 1-base mismatch off-target sites, and had CFD scores >0.2.

The control sgRNA was designed to target Gαs, but was repurposed as a control because it did not cause mutations orreduce GαsmRNA or protein. The AAV-expression vector plasmid was generously provided by the University of Michi-gan Vector Core.

BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice have impaired BMAd lipolysis, and increased size and number of BMAds at baseline. Although energy from BMAd lipid stores is largely dispensable when mice are fed ad libitum, BMAd lipolysis is necessary to maintain myelopoiesis and bone mass under caloric restriction. BMAd- specific Pnpla2 deficiency compounds the effects of caloric restriction on loss of trabecular bone in male mice, likely due to impaired osteoblast expression of collagen genes and reduced osteoid synthesis. RNA sequencing analysis of bone marrow adipose tissue reveals that caloric restriction induces dramatic elevations in extracellular matrix organization and skeletal devel- opment genes, and energy from BMAd is required for these adaptations.

Editor's evaluation Through the cell selective deletion in bone marrow marrow adipocytes (BMAds) of an enzyme for lipolysis, the authors demonstrate elegantly a role for this pathway in the maintenance of hema- topoiesis and bone mass during periods of caloric stress, injury and energy restriction. This study establishes for the first time a role for the bone marrow adipocyte in energy balance. Introduction Adipocytes are found throughout the body, and can be classified generally into white, brown, beige/ BRITE and bone marrow adipose tissues (BMAT); however, many other niche depots exist, and adipo- cyte subpopulations within specific depots have recently been identified (Bagchi et al., 2018; Emont et al., 2022; Sárvári et al., 2021). In an adult human, 50–70% of the bone marrow cavity is filled with BMAT, which contributes ~10% of the total body fat mass (Cawthorn et al., 2014). BMAT was RESEARCH ARTICLE *For correspondence: macdouga@umich.edu Competing interest: The authors declare that no competing interests exist.

{"prompt": "interactions between cells within the bone marrow niche. In addition to bone marrow adipocytes (BMAds), the bone marrow niche contains osteoblasts, osteoclasts, hematopoietic cells, stromal/mesenchymal cells, blood vessels, and nerves (Vogler and Murphy, 1988). The relationships between BMAds, bone cells, and hematopoietic cells are influenced by their shared location within bone, an anatomically restricted system, such that expansion of one cell type is by necessity at the expense of others. For example, elevated BMAT is inversely correlated with low bone mass of aging and diabetes, whereas expansion of BMAT is associated with multiple hematopoietic disorders (Li and MacDougald, 2021). Mecha- nistic links underlying these associations have proven challenging to investigate because these often involve complex intercellular, endocrine, and/or central mechanisms. In addition to serving as an energy source, BMAds potentially influence the marrow niche through cell- to- cell contact, release of extracellular vesicles, and secretion of adipokines (e.g. adiponectin and leptin) and cytokines (e.g. adipsin, RANK ligand, and stem cell factor; Aaron et al., 2021; Li et al., 2018). Removal of these stimuli in mouse models of lipodystrophy, which lack BMAT, results in increased bone mass (Corsa et al., 2021; Zou et al., 2020; Zou et al., 2019). However, use of these models to investigate direct effects of BMAT depletion is confounded by concurrent loss of white and brown adipose depots, which also regulate bone mass through myriad mechanisms, including secre- tion of adipokines (Riddle and Clemens, 2017; Zou et al., 2019). Although loss of BMAT in lipodys- trophic mice was integral to the original finding that BMAT is a negative regulator of hematopoiesis, positive effects of BMAT on hematopoiesis have also been observed; these differences are attributed to use of distinct animal models and analysis of different skeletal sites (Ambrosi et al., 2017; Naveiras et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2017). In rodents, there are two", "completion": ""}
{"prompt": "readily identifiable BMAd populations: constitutive BMAT (cBMAT) and regulated BMAT (rBMAT) (Scheller et al., 2015). cBMAT typically exists in distal tibia and caudal vertebrae, appears early in life, and has the histological appearance of white adipose tissue. rBMAT is found in proximal tibia and distal femur, and is comprised of single or clustered BMAds interspersed with hematopoietic cells. Although cBMAT generally resists change in response to altered physiological states, rBMAT expands with aging, obesity, diabetes, caloric restric- tion (CR), irradiation, and estrogen deficiency, and is reduced by cold exposure, β3- agonist, exercise, and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (Li et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019). These treatments also cause alter - ations to the skeleton and/or formation of blood cells, some of which may be secondary to effects on BMAds. In contrast, BMAds have also been thought to fuel maintenance of bone and hematopoietic cellularity because of their shared physical location in the marrow niche. Indeed, Steele, 1884 wrote that fat in marrow 'nourishes the skeleton'; however, that conjecture has not been formally tested because current methods to target BMAds lack penetrance or cause recombination in other cell types, such as white adipocytes, osteoblasts, or bone marrow stromal cells, complicating the interpretation of interactions between BMAds and cells of the marrow niche. To circumvent this problem, we created a BMAd- specific Cre mouse model based on expression patterns of endoge- nous Osterix and Adipoq, and investigated the role of BMAds as a local energy source by deleting ATGL/Pnpla2, the rate- limiting enzyme of lipolysis. Consistent with Pnpla2 deficiency in white and brown adipocytes (Ahmadian et al., 2011), BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice have impaired BMAd lipolysis, resulting in hypertrophy and hyperplasia of BMAT. Despite significant increases in bone marrow adiposity, hematopoietic abnormalities of BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice are negligible under basal condi- tions. However, the recovery of bone", "completion": ""}

Similarly, the proliferative capacity of myeloid progenitors is also decreased with CR, and further inhibited in mice lacking BMAd-Pnpla2. Whereas alterations in bone parameters were not observed in ad libitum fed BMAd- Pnpla2-/- mice, bone loss occurred under conditions of elevated energy needs such as bone regen- eration or cold exposure, or reduced energy availability such as CR. Reduction of bone mass in CR BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice is likely due to impaired osteoblast functions such as expression of extracel- lular matrix genes and creation of osteoid.

Results Generation of a BMAd-specific Cre mouse model (BMAd-Cre) Based on previous studies showing that Osterix traces to osteoblasts and BMAds, but not to white adipocytes (Chen and Long, 2013; Mizo- guchi et al., 2014), we used CRISPR/Cas9 to create Osterix- FLPo mice with an in- frame fusion of Osterix and optimized FLPo, separated by a P2A self- cleaving sequence to allow indepen- dent functioning of the two proteins (Figure 1A). To validate tissue- specific expression and FLPo efficiency, we bred Osterix- FLPo mice to FLP- dependent EGFP reporter mice, and observed EGFP- positive osteocytes, osteoblasts, BMAds, and a subset of marrow stromal cells within the bone (Figure 1B and C).

However, because Adipoq is selec- tively expressed in adipocytes (Eguchi et al., 2011), Cre was expressed in BMAds, but not in osteoblasts or other adipose depots. Consistent with this schema, Cre in the correct orientation (flipped band, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C) was only observed in caudal vertebral DNA of mice that were positive for at least one copy each of Osterix (Mut band) and FAC (Ori band). The correct orientation of Cre (flipped band) was also observed in mRNA isolated from distal tibiae and caudal vertebrae, but not WAT depots, of Osterix- FLPo mice positive for FAC (Figure 1— figure supplement 1D). The correct insertion of the sequence in Adipoq 3'-UTR was validated by Sanger sequencing following genomic PCRs that spanned endogenous Adipoq sequences, homology arms, IRES and Cre (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E). To investigate the cell type specificity of Cre activity, we next bred BMAd- Cre mice to mT/mG reporter mice (Muzumdar et al., 2007; Figure 1E), in which all tissues and cells express red fluorescence (membrane- targeted tdTomato; mT) at baseline, and will express membrane- targeted EGFP in the presence of Figure 1.

We observed loss of tdTomato and gain of EGFP in BMAT depots of caudal verte- brae (tail) and tibiae, but not in brown or white adipose depots, or other tissues/organs such as liver, pancreas, muscle and spleen (Figure 1E and Figure 1—figure supplement 1F). To eval- uate conditions optimal for Cre- induced recom- bination, we visualized conversion of tdTomato to EGFP in BMAd- Cre mice at various ages and with different FAC copy numbers (Figure 1—figure supplement 1G–H) and found that the propor - tion of EGFP- positive BMAds increased with age and number of FAC alleles. Indeed, Cre efficiency was ~80% in both male and female mice over 16 weeks of age with one Cre allele, and over 90% at 12 weeks of age in mice with two Cre alleles (Figure 1—figure supplement 1I). Previous studies found that a randomly inserted Adipoq- Cre bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) causes recombination in osteoblasts (Bozec et al., 2013; Eguchi et al., 2011; Mukohira et al., 2019); thus, we tested whether this observation is true in BMAd- Cre mice, which rely on endoge- nous Adipoq expression that is further restricted by Osterix. When BMAd- Cre mice were bred to mT/mG reporter mice, only tdTomato- positive cells were detectable on trabecular bone surfaces (Figure 1F), suggesting that osteoblasts were not targeted.

{"prompt": "likely due to expression of Adipoq within this cell population (Mukohira et al., 2019). Although insertion of the FLPo- activated Cre cassette into the 3’-UTR of endogenous Adipoq over - comes potential problems that arise from random genomic integration, we considered the possibility that placement of the IRES- Cre cassette within the 3’-UTR might alter the expression and/or secretion of endogenous adiponectin. We found that insertion of the IRES- Cre cassette caused a small, non- significant decrease in Adipoq mRNA expression in whole caudal vertebrae or distal tibiae, whereas adiponectin mRNA in white adipose tissue was elevated by more than threefold (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A). Thus, the cassette itself did not limit expression of mRNA. Instead, it appeared that the 2 kb IRES- Cre cassette within the 3'-UTR impairs translatability of the mRNA since expression of adiponectin protein in WAT and BMAT was decreased by ~50% (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and C). Circulating adiponectin concentrations were decreased even further (Figure 1—figure supple- ment 2D–F), suggesting that flux of translated adiponectin protein was impaired through the secre- tion pathway. Of note, hypoadiponectinemia is associated with insulin resistance (Cook and Semple, 2010; Li et al., 2021), with discrepant effects reported on osteogenesis (Lewis et al., 2021). Thus, we evaluated systemic metabolism in BMAd- Cre mice and found that body weight, glucose tolerance, WAT depot weights, and tibial trabecular and cortical bone variables were unaffected by this degree of hypoadiponectinemia (Figure 1—figure supplement 2G–P). To minimize variability between treat- ments, all mice used in the following studies were positive for both Osterix- FLPo (predominantly two alleles) and FAC (mostly two alleles).

ATGL is the first and rate- limiting enzyme in the lipolytic process; thus, to determine the physiological functions of BMAd lipolysis in bone metabolism and hematopoiesis, we generated BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice, in which the gene encoding ATGL, Pnpla2, was specifically deleted in BMAds. We validated the deletion of ATGL in caudal vertebrae, because cBMAT is abundant in this location. Mutant Pnpla2 mRNA was observed in caudal vertebrae of BMAd-Pnpla2 mice, but not in WAT (Figure 2A). Possible sources for the remaining wildtype (WT) Pnpla2 signal include periosteal WAT, non- adipocyte cells, or perhaps from incomplete deletion of Pnpla2 in BMAds.

On the other hand, forskolin treatment greatly increased lipolysis in BMAT explants from control mice, but secretion of glycerol and NEFA from BMAd-Pnpla2-/- explants remained unchanged from basal rates (Figure 2K–M). These results confirm that BMAds of BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice have impaired lipolysis. BMAd lipolysis is required to maintain bone homeostasis in male mice under conditions of CR, but not when mice are fed ad libitum We next evaluated whether loss of BMAd lipolysis in male BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice is sufficient to influ- ence systemic physiology, or function of bone cells within the marrow niche. In mice fed normal chow ad libitum, we did not observe differences in body weight, glucose tolerance, or weights of soft tissue, including subcutaneous WAT (sWAT), epididymal WAT (eWAT), and liver (Figure 3—figure supple- ment 1A- E), which further confirmed the tissue- specificity of our BMAd-Pnpla2 knockout model. As observed above, Pnpla2 deficiency caused expansion of proximal tibial rBMAT (Figure 3—figure supplement 1F and G). Interestingly, when dietary energy was readily available, trabecular bone volume fraction, bone mineral density and trabecular number tended to be lower in BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice, but statistical differences were not observed (Figure 3A–C). Our experiments", "completion": ""}
{"prompt": "in ad libitum fed mice suggest that energy released from BMAds is dispensable for bone cell functioning when dietary energy is plentiful, which is supported by the comparable concentrations of glycerol and NEFA in circulation and in bone marrow supernatant in BMAd- Pnpla2+/+ and BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice (Figure 3—figure supplement 1H and I). To determine whether male BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice have impaired bone homeostasis when dietary energy is limited, we next challenged mice with a 30% CR for 6 weeks. BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice did not have altered body weight, glucose tolerance, or tissue weights comparing with their controls (Figure 3—figure supplement 1J- N), suggesting that BMAds were not a critical source of circulating energy under these conditions. Although Pnpla2-/- mice fed ad libitum had increased rBMAT compared to controls (Figure 3—figure supplement 1F and G), CR stimulated rBMAT expansion in control mice such that BMAT volume and BMAd size were comparable between genotypes (Figure 3—figure supplement 1O- S). Despite having a similar amount of rBMAT, BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice fed CR diet had reduced trabecular bone volume fraction, connective density, and bone mineral density when compared to controls (Figure 3D and E). This reduction in bone mass is due to decreased trabecular bone number and increased trabecular spacing, without effects on trabecular thickness (Figure 3F). BMAds are a source of NEFA for vicinal osteoblasts (Maridas et al., 2019); thus, the reduction in trabecular bone in CR BMAd- Pnpla2-/- mice likely resulted from impaired osteoblast function due to insufficient energy available in the bone marrow niche. Consistent with this notion, we observed a trend (p=0.07) towards reduced NEFA concentrations in bone marrow supernatant of CR BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice, whilst circulating glyc- erol and NEFA concentrations were not different between genotypes (Figure 3—figure supplement 1T and U).

Comparable adiponectin concentrations between BMAd- Pnpla2+/+ and BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice (Figure 3—figure supplement 1V) excludes the possibility that differences in circulating adiponectin may confound the bone phenotype in BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice. Finally, changes in cortical bone area and thickness were not observed in BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice with either ad libitum or CR diet (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A- D), perhaps because cortical bone surfaces are less active. To investigate mechanisms underlying trabecular bone loss in CR BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice, we next measured circulating markers of bone cell activity and performed histomorphometry. Osteoblast and osteoclast numbers and osteoclast surface were not changed by BMAd-Pnpla2 deficiency under ad libitum conditions (Figure 3—figure supplement 2E and F). Although circulating markers of bone formation (P1NP) and osteoclast activation (RANK Ligand) were not altered in BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice, markers for bone resorption (CTX- 1) and osteoclast activation (TRACP5b) were decreased or showed a strong trend towards reduction, respectively (Figure 3—figure supplement 2G- J). Although with CR, osteoblast numbers were not altered by a deficiency of BMAT lipolysis, the bone formation marker P1NP was decreased (Figure 3G and I), suggesting that osteoblast functions were impaired.

Dynamic histomorphometry data suggests that BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice had less bone- forming surface, as indicated by reduced single- labelled surface (sLS) and mineral surface (MS) (Figure 3L). There were no differences in double- labelled bone surface, inter- label width, mineral appo- sition rate or osteoid maturation time (Figure 3M and Figure 3—figure supplement 2N), suggesting that bone mineralization is not affected by loss of BMAd lipolysis. Taken together, these data support a model in which reduced trabecular bone in BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice is likely due to impaired ability of osteoblasts to secrete osteoid. BMAd lipolysis is not required to maintain bone homeostasis under calorie-restricted conditions in female mice To determine whether sex influences responses of BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice to CR, we performed similar experiments in female mice at 20 weeks of age. As expected, after six weeks of CR, both control and knockout mice exhibited comparable reduced body weights, random blood glucose concen- trations, and tissue weights (Figure 3—figure supplement 3A and B).

These data suggest that the metabolic benefits of CR diet may combat detri- mental effects of estrogen deficiency and/or aging. Although not observed in intact mice, with OVX Pnpla2- deficient mice, the loss of BMAd ATGL caused a slight reduction in trabecular bone mineral density (Tb. BMD) and thickness (Tb.

BMAd lipolytic deficiency impairs myelopoiesis during regeneration A single rBMAd connects to almost 100 hematopoietic cells (Robles et al., 2019), suggesting that BMAds potentially serve as important local energy sources for hematopoiesis. However, when fed ad libitum, male BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice did not exhibit differences in mature blood cells populations, as assessed by complete blood cell counts (Supplementary file 1) or in bone marrow hematopoietic cell populations, as assessed by flow cytometry (Supplementary file 2 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B). However, we did observe a reduced percentage of bone marrow mature neutrophils in CR BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice (Supplementary file 1, Supplementary file 2), perhaps due to impaired maturation of granulocytes. These data suggest that although neutrophil defects were observed in CR BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice, other hematopoietic cell populations can metabolically compensate for the lack of BMAd lipolytic products. To investigate further whether hematopoiesis is dependent upon BMAd lipolysis, we administered a sublethal dose of whole- body irradiation, and evaluated hematopoietic cell recovery. Following irradiation, white and red blood cell depletion and recovery were monitored by complete blood cell counts every 2–3 days (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C- E).

Nine days after irradiation, HSPCs (Figure 4—figure supplement 1F and G) and mature/immature hematopoi- etic cells (Figure 4A–H) were not influenced by deficiency of BMAd- lipolysis in ad libitum fed mice. However, CR decreased bone marrow cellularity (BMNC) (Figure 4A), and most HSPC populations in control mice (Figure 4—figure supplement 1F and G). Two- way ANOVA also revealed inhibitory effects of CR on monocytes and neutrophils, without changes to lymphocytes (Figure 4B–E). In BMAd- Pnpla2-/- mice, HSPCs were not altered by CR except for PreMegE cells, which were suppressed. Bone marrow cellularity, monocytes, and neutrophils were also decreased in CR BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice. The recovery of neutrophils, preneutrophils, immature and mature neutrophils following irradiation was impaired by CR, and Pnpla2- deficiency further reduced ability of neutrophils and mature neutrophils to regenerate (Figure 4E–H). These reductions in monocytes and neutrophils in CR BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice suggest that BMAd- lipolysis is required for myeloid cell lineage regeneration when energy supply from circulation is limited.

Pathway analyses of cluster 1 with Metascape (https://metascape.org) revealed that regulated genes were associated with vasculature development and cellular response to growth factor stimulus, which likely reflects adaptation mechanisms to compensate for energy insufficiency (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C). In addition, genes associated with skeletal system development, extracellular matrix organization, and adipogenesis pathways were upregulated by CR in control mice, but these effects were blunted by Pnpla2 deletion (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C). Cluster 2 includes genes that were mildly upregulated by CR in control mice and were further increased with Pnpla2- deficiency. Although no specific pathways were enriched in this gene set, upregulation of two monocarboxylate transporters, Slc16a11 and Slc16a4, suggests a potential mechanism for fueling cellular metabolism, and perhaps for the energy source underlying expansion of BMAd with CR and BMAd Pnpla2 deletion (Figure 5—figure", "completion": ""}

Cluster 3 highlighted genes that were downregulated by CR treatment regardless of genotype (Figure 5—figure supplement 1E), and that were associated with B cell proliferation and interleukin- 8 production, which may partially explain changes in hematopoietic cellularity. Cluster 4 contained 80 genes that were down- regulated independently by CR and Pnpla2-deficiency, and were associated with regulation of ossification and calcium- mediated signaling (Figure 5—figure supplement 1F). To evaluate further whether BMAd-Pnpla2 is required for the adaptation of BMAT to CR, we graph- ically ordered genes from those maximally induced to those most repressed by CR in control mice (Figure 5B; red dots). Of these genes, 66% did not meet our criteria for regulated expression by CR in BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice (blue dots). Pathway analyses on the 34% of genes regulated by CR regard- less of Pnpla2 deficiency revealed association with ribonuclease activity, response to hormones and other transmembrane signaling pathways (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A). Pathway analyses of genes for which Pnpla2 is required for response to CR identified vasculature development and cellular response to growth factor stimulus, similar to cluster 1, followed closely by skeletal system develop- ment, adipogenesis genes, and extracellular matrix organization pathways (Figure 5C). A heatmap showed that the adipogenic genes, including Adipoq, Fabp4, Cebpa, Lipe, Lpl, Ppara, Pparg, Scd1, Plin1, Cd36, Fasn, and Acaca, were upregulated by CR in control mice (Figure 5D), a subset of which were confirmed by qPCR (Figure 5—figure supplement 2B). These changes may help to explain molecular mechanisms underlying BMAT expansion following CR. It is important to note that whereas CR BMAd-Pnpla2+/+ and BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice had comparable amounts of BMAT (Figure 3—figure supplement 1O and P), adipocyte gene expression was greatly suppressed in mice with BMAT lacking Pnpla2 (Figure 5D).

In addition, genes related to endogenous fatty acid biosynthesis were also increased by CR in BMAd-Pnpla2+/+ mice, but not in mice lacking Pnpla2 (Figure 5—figure supplement 2C). Interestingly, myeloid leukocyte differentiation genes followed a similar pattern (Figure 5—figure supplement 2D), which may contribute to the reduced neutrophil production and impaired myeloid cell proliferation of CR BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice (Supplementary file 1, Supplementary file 2, and Figure 4). We previously observed increased bone loss in BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice challenged with CR (Figure 3). To investigate potential mechanisms underlying this bone loss, we analyzed pathways from Cluster 1 related to bone metabolism, skeletal system development and extracellular matrix organization. Inter - estingly, osteoblast- derived alkaline phosphatase (Alpl), Col1a1 and Col1a2, and bone marrow Fgf/ Fgfr and Wnt signaling- related molecules were highly induced by CR in control mice but not in Pnpla2- deficient mice (Figure 5E); many of these genes are also found in the ossification pathway. Multiple collagen genes, Lox, and Adamts (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin motifs) family members, which are multidomain extracellular protease enzymes and play key roles in extracel- lular matrix remodeling, were also upregulated by CR in control mice, with effects largely eliminated Figure supplement 2.

These findings may partially explain why osteoid thickness tended to be thinner in BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice (Figure 3K). In this regard, 20 collagen genes were significantly up- regulated in control mice following CR (Figure 5—figure supplement 2E), whereas only four collagen genes were elevated in CR BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice. Taken together, these data suggest that under conditions of limited dietary energy, BMAds provide energy to maintain osteoblast functions, including the secretion of collagen matrix for osteoid synthesis. As mentioned above, loss of Pnpla2 in CR mice altered expression of 1060 genes (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B; right), which were clustered into three groups (Figure 5—figure supplement 3A). Cluster 1 included genes that were induced only in CR BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice. Although not localized to specific pathways, these genes were involved in diverse metabolic and cellular processes (e.g. Perm1, mt- Nd6, and B3gat2), and were generally expressed at low levels at baseline. In contrast, cluster 2 contained genes that were suppressed in CR BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice, including pathways related to mitochondrial functions, hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation, positive regulation of osteo- blast differentiation and fatty acid biosynthetic process (Figure 5—figure supplement 3B and C), which sheds further light on the impaired HSPC proliferative capacity and osteoblast functions. Genes in cluster 3 were upregulated by CR, but not by CR in the absence of BMAd-Pnpla2. Pathway analyses highlighted the regulation of lipid catabolic process, triacylglyceride synthesis and leukocyte migra- tion (Figure 5—figure supplement 3D and E), consistent with the impaired lipid metabolism and leukocyte production observed in BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice.

To do this, we created a 0.7 mm hole in the proximal tibia, approximately 1–2 mm distal from the growth plate, and evaluated the newly formed woven bone in both the trabecular (endocortical) and cortical compartments nine days later (Figure 6A). As expected, CR impaired formation of bone in the trabecular (endocortical) region of interest (ROI), resulting in decreased bone volume fraction, mineral density, and mineral content (Figure 6B). Importantly, these effects of CR were mimicked by BMAd- specific Pnpla2 deletion; however, gene deletion did not compound effects of CR on impaired bone regeneration, perhaps because newly- formed bone volume was already low with either CR or Pnpla2 deficiency alone. We then visualized newly formed bone in the cortical bone compartment with Safr - anin O/ Fast Green (SO/FG) staining of paraffin- embedded proximal tibia sections (Figure 6C). Of note, both bone marrow stromal and periosteal cells contribute to the cortical bone regeneration and are derived from common mesenchymal progenitors (Duchamp de Lageneste et al., 2018). Although deficiency of BMAd- lipolysis is unlikely to affect periosteal cell functions when the cortical bone is intact, it may interact with this cell population during bone regeneration. CR also impaired forma- tion of new woven bone in the cortical compartment by decreasing bone volume fraction, mineral density, and mineral content. As with bone formation in the trabecular compartment, effects of CR on the cortical compartment are mimicked by BMAd- specific depletion of Pnpla2, and effects of impaired BMAd lipolysis did not exacerbate CR- induced impaired bone regeneration (Figure 6D).

As expected (Scheller et al., 2015; Scheller et al., 2019), cold exposure resulted in smaller rBMAds within the proximal tibia of BMAd-Pnpla2+/+ mice (Figure 6E and F). In contrast, rBMAd size was increased at baseline in BMAd- Pnpla2-/- mice, with no reduction observed with cold exposure (Figure 6E and G).

Interest- ingly, control BMAd-Pnpla2+/+ male mice were more vulnerable to cold- induced bone loss than female mice, with significant reductions of trabecular bone volume fraction, mineral density, and thickness. There was no obvious further decrease of these parameters in BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice, perhaps because bone volume was already low with cold exposure. However, two- way ANOVA analyses revealed there were interactions between temperature and genotype, suggesting there were further changes in BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice (Figure 6—figure supplement 1E,F,H ). Although cold stimuli did not affect the microstructure parameters of trabecular bone in BMAd-Pnpla2+/+ mice, cold exposure decreased trabecular connective density and trabecular number, and increased trabecular bone spacing in BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice (Figure 6—figure supplement 1G,I,J and ). Taken together, these data highlight sexual dimorphism in the response of bone to cold, and that in both males and females, a further loss of bone is observed when BMAT lipolysis is impaired. Discussion In the current study, we developed and tested for the first time, a BMAd- specific mouse model to more clearly understand the function of bone marrow adipose tissue, particularly during times of nutritional, hormonal, mechanical and environmental stress. Previously, the role of BMAds in the marrow niche was deduced through indirect inferences from associations of skeletal and hematopoietic phenotypes with bone marrow adipose tissue volume. This has been exemplified by a number of BMAT depletion models which showed high bone mass, including A- ZIP (Naveiras et al., 2009), Adipoq- driven DTA (Zou et al., 2019), and Adipoq- driven loss of Pparg (Wang et al., 2013), Lmna (Corsa et al., 2021), or Bscl2 (Mcilroy et al., 2018); however these lipodystrophic mice also lacked white and brown adipose depots and thus exhibit global metabolic dysfunction, including fatty liver, hyperlipidemia and", "completion": ""}

Similarly, mouse models or treatments that result in BMAT expansion, such as Prx1- driven Pth1r knockout mice (Fan et al., 2017), CR, thiazolidinedione administration, estrogen- deficiency, and irradiation (Li and MacDougald, 2021), also caused bone loss, but again, effects on bone may be secondary to lack of promoter specificity or confounding systemic effects. Lineage tracing studies have previously been performed to determine cell- specific markers for BMAds. For example, both Prx1 and Osterix are restricted to bone and trace to 100% of BMAds, but are also expressed in mesenchymal cells (Logan et al., 2002; Mizoguchi et al., 2014). Nestin and leptin receptor (Lepr) label over 90% of BMAds, but also trace to stromal cells (Zhou et al., 2017). Whereas Pdgf- receptor α (Pdgfrα)- driven Cre expression causes recombination in all white adipocytes, only 50–70% of BMAds are traced (Horowitz et al., 2017). Thus, our successful strategy for targeting BMAds using dual expression of Osterix and Adipoq, as reported in this work, improves the interpretability of experiments on the distinct roles of BMAds in the marrow niche and will be a useful tool for future investigations.The online version of this article includes the following source data and figure supplement(s) for figure 6: Source data 1.

{"prompt": "successfully ablated Pnpla2 in BMAds, and demonstrated the necessity of ATGL in BMAd lipolysis. Our studies directly demonstrate for the first time the importance of BMAd lipolysis in myelopoiesis and bone homeostasis under condi- tions of energetic stress, including CR, irradiation, bone regeneration and cold exposure. With the loss of peripheral WAT in CR mice, there is a dramatic increase in BMAT throughout the tibia, and this is accompanied by increased expression of adipocyte genes, including those involved in lipid uptake, de novo lipogenesis, and lipolysis. BMAT expansion with CR has been observed in both rodents and humans (Cawthorn et al., 2014; Devlin et al., 2010; Fazeli et al., 2021), and mechanisms underlying this observation are still not fully understood. We speculate that CR promotes lipolysis in periph- eral adipose tissues, and the released non- esterified fatty acids have increased flux to bone marrow, where they are used either directly to maintain hematopoiesis and bone homeostasis, or used indi- rectly after having been stored and released from BMAT. The RNAseq data also suggests that BMAds have elevated rates of lipid uptake, lipogenesis and lipolysis with CR in control mice. However, when BMAd lipolysis is impaired, this dynamic cycle is halted, which is reflected by the blunted induction of adipocyte genes in response to CR. This BMAd quiescence causes a shortfall in local energy supply and contributes to hematopoietic cell and osteoblast dysfunction. In this regard, two major colla- gens secreted by osteoblasts, Col1a1 and Col1a2, and Alpl were increased by CR in control BMAd- Pnpla2+/+ mice, but not in calorie- restricted BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice. These data are consistent with the trend for thinner osteoid observed in CR BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice and reduced circulating concentrations of the bone formation marker P1NP . Although bone mineralization is not impaired, new bone forming surface is reduced in CR mice that lack BMAd lipolysis. In addition, the number of osteoclasts on trabecular bone", "completion": ""}
{"prompt": "surface is higher in CR BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice; however, osteoclast surface per bone surface and a circulating marker of bone turnover (CTX- 1) are not increased. A serum marker for osteoclast activity, TRACP5b, is decreased in BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice either fed ad libitum or a CR diet. Taken together, our studies suggest that bone mass reduction in CR BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice is less likely due to degradation of bone by osteoclasts, and more likely due to impaired osteoblast function, including collagen secretion and osteoid production. Interestingly, the contributions of BMAd lipolysis to bone homeostasis appear to be more important in male mice compared to females. Although we considered that a stronger phenotype might be revealed in female mice following estrogen depletion, the low bone mass observed with ovariectomy or CR may represent a critical threshold that is strongly defended through mechanisms independent of BMAd lipolysis. Alternatively, it is possible that androgens increase energy requirements of bone such that male mice are more dependent on BMAd lipolysis under stressful conditions. Consistent with this tenet, in both mouse and human studies of calorie restriction, males tend to have greater induction of BMAds than females (Fazeli et al., 2021). Importantly, we observed that bone volume fraction and trabecular number were increased by 12 weeks of CR in OVX mice of both genotypes, suggesting that the metabolic and anti- aging benefits of CR somehow block the bone loss associated with estrogen deficiency as mice aged to 40 weeks. Surprisingly, despite expansion of BMAT in ad libitum- fed BMAd-Pnpla2-/- male and female mice, we did not observe differences in skeletal parameters, indicating that expansion of BMAT is not suffi- cient to cause bone loss, and that the correlation between elevated fracture risk and expansion of BMAT under a variety of clinical situations is not necessarily a causal relationship.

{"prompt": "when energy needs were high, or when the availability of dietary energy was low. Of note, cellular protein synthesis typically uses 25–30% of the oxygen consumption coupled to ATP synthesis (Rolfe and Brown, 1997), and this percentage may be higher in osteoblasts since protein synthesis and translation are integral to osteoblast function. Additionally, fatty acids contribute substantially to the energy demands of bone tissue and cells (Adamek et al., 1987), and in the absence of BMAd lipolysis, these energy needs must be met from circulating lipids, glucose, lactate, and amino acids. Uptake of fatty acids by osteoblasts is likely mediated by the CD36 fatty acid translocase, which is required in mice to maintain osteoblast numbers and activity (Kevorkova et al., 2013). Further, impairment of fatty acid oxida- tion in osteoblasts and osteocytes led to reduced postnatal bone acquisition in female, but not male mice. Interestingly, significant increases in the osteoid thickness, osteoid volume per bone volume, and the osteoid maturation time suggest that a mineralization defect occurs in mice unable to oxidize fatty acids obtained not only from BMAds, but also from circulation (Kim et al., 2017). Although we Research article Cell Biology Li et al. eLife 2022;11:e78496. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.78496 17 of 32have largely interpreted effects of Pnpla2 deficiency as causing a local energy shortfall, Pnpla2 defi- ciency may also alter downstream signaling activities. For example, ATGL deficiency prevents cAMP- dependent degradation of TXNIP and thus reduces glucose uptake and lactate secretion (Beg et al., 2021). ATGL- catalyzed lipolysis also provides essential mediators to increase activity of PGC- 1α/ PPARα and PPARδpathways (Haemmerle et al., 2011; Khan et al., 2015).

One possibility is that skeletal sites containing low BMAd numbers, including verte- brae, sternum, ribs and pelvis, may allow compensatory formation of circulating mature blood cells (Kricun, 1985). In addition, hematopoietic progenitors and mature blood cell populations were not substantially altered in bone marrow of long bones, with the exception of myeloid differentiation into neutrophils, suggesting that hematopoietic cellularity is generally maintained despite expansion of BMAT volume. Although hematopoietic progenitors and mature cells can use lipids for energy, glucose serves as the major source of energy for glycolysis and oxidative metabolism in these cell populations (Jeon et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2018). It is perhaps unsurprising, given the importance of blood cell production in maintaining life, that there is a great deal of metabolic flexibility when it comes to fuel sources for hematopoiesis. While HSPC numbers are unaltered in our BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice, myeloid lineage cell recovery is significantly blunted by CR and deficiency of BMAd- lipolysis following sublethal irradiation and in in vitro myeloid CFU assays. Myeloid progenitors from CR BMAd- Pnpla2-/- mice had an impaired capacity to expand, suggesting that progenitors were reprogrammed in response to energy deficiency in the bone marrow niche. We did not profile the metabolic changes of HSPCs in CR BMAd-Pnpla2-/- mice, but it has been reported that fatty acid oxidation is required for HSC asymmetric division to retain the stem cell properties (Ito et al., 2012).

In addi- tion, we find that BMAT serves a highly specialized function to maintain bone mass and osteoblast function in times of elevated local energy needs such as with bone regeneration, increased whole body energy needs from cold exposure, or when dietary energy is limited due to CR. Thus, Steele’s instincts in 1884 when he wrote that fat from marrow 'nourishes the skeleton' are largely borne out by modern experimentation. Limitations of study There are some limitations to the BMAd- Cre mice that should be noted. For instance, expression of Cre from the IRES within the 3'-UTR of Adipoq is relatively low, and thus rates of recombination are less frequent in young mice than optimal. Mice that are older than 16 weeks are suggested for future usage of this Cre mouse model. However, bone formation and turnover rates decrease with age both in mice and humans (Fatayerji and Eastell, 1999; Ferguson et al., 2003), which may provide challenges for mechanistic studies. The IRES- Cre cassette also causes hypoadiponectinemia so exper - imental design must include appropriate controls with BMAd- Cre positive mice with or without floxed genes. Although a total absence of adiponectin reduces bone mass (Naot et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2020), mice with hypoadiponectinemia described here did not exhibit metabolic or bone phenotypes. In retrospect, a better approach might have been to accept loss of one Adipoq allele and insert the FAC cassette at the start site of the adiponectin coding region to promote high levels of Cre expression. This strategy might also have allowed inducible knockout of BMAd genes with tamoxifen through expression of CreERT2, which we found to be too inefficient to be functional when inserted into the 3'-UTR of Adipoq, with only 5–8% BMAds labeled in tamoxifen- treated adult mice.

Of note, Osterix- FLPo and FAC mice were generated on a mixed SJL and C57BL/6J background. Pnpla2flox/flox mice purchased from Jackson laboratory (Stock No. 024278; Bar Harbor, ME) were on a C57BL/6J background. Animal housing Mice were housed in a 12 hr light/dark cycle in the Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine at the Univer - sity of Michigan, with free access to water. Mice were fed ad libitum or underwent caloric restriction, as indicated. All procedures were approved by the University of Michigan Committee on the Use and Care of Animals with the protocol number as PRO00009687. Animal procedures 1. 30% CR. After acclimation to single- housing for 2 weeks, and control diet (D17110202; Research Diets; New Brunswick, NJ) for a week, daily food intake was measured for another week. Mice were then fed a 30% CR diet (D19051601; Research Diets; New Brunswick, NJ) daily at ~6 pm, prior to onset of the dark cycle. 2. Ovariectomy. Female mice at 16 weeks of age underwent ovariectomy (OVX). After 2 weeks recovery, they were either fed an ad libitum or 30% CR diet for 12 weeks. 3. Proximal tibial defect. Surgeries were performed under isoflurane anesthesia, and subcutaneous 0.1 mg/kg buprenorphine was given in 12 h intervals for peri-/post- operative pain management. The proximal tibial defects were obtained by drilling a hole through anterior cortical and trabec- ular bone, 1–2 mm below the epiphyseal growth plate, with a 0.7 mm low- speed drill. 4.

Irradiations were carried out using a Kimtron IC320 (Kimtron Medical; Oxford, CT) at a dose rate of ~4 Gy/min with total dosage of 6 Gy in the University of Mich- igan Rogel Cancer Center Experimental Irradiation Shared Resource. Dosimetry was carried out using an ionization chamber connected to an electrometer system that is directly traceable to a National Institute of Standards and Technology calibration. Fresh tissue confocal microscopy Osterix- driven EGFP expression and BMAd-Cre- driven mT/mG reporter mice were sacrificed. Fresh tissues were collected immediately and put in ice- cold PBS, which was protected from light. Soft tissues including adipose tissues and liver were cut into small pieces and placed in a chamber for confocal imaging (Nikon Ti- E Inverted Microscope; Minato City, Tokyo, Japan). Bones were bisected and butterflied on a coverslip for imaging. Both white field and fluorescent images were taken under ×200 magnification. Histology and histomorphometry Tissue histology was performed essentially as described previously (Li et al., 2019). Briefly, soft tissues were fixed in formalin, and embedded in paraffin for sectioning. Tibiae were fixed in paraformal- dehyde, decalcified in EDTA for at least 2 weeks, and followed by post- decalcification fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. Bone tissues were then embedded in paraffin, sectioned. After staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), soft tissues were imaged with an Olympus BX51 microscope.

Scan settings were: voxel size 12 µm, 70 kVp, 114 µA, 0.5 mm AL filter, and integration time 500ms. Density measure- ments were calibrated to the manufacturer’s hydroxyapatite phantom. Analysis was performed using the manufacturer’s evaluation software with a threshold of 180 for trabecular bone and 280 for cortical bone. Marrow fat quantification by osmium tetroxide staining and μCT After analyses of bone variables, mouse tibiae were decalcified for osmium tetroxide staining, using our previously published method (Scheller et al., 2015). In addition, a lower threshold (300 grey- scale units) was used for proximal tibial rBMAT quantification because density of osmium staining is low due to smaller adipocyte size, and with threshold as 400 grey- scale units for cBMAT in distal tibia. Immunofluorescent staining Decalcified tibiae were embedded in OCT compound and used for frozen sectioning at 15 μm.

Two hours later, DAPI staining was performed. Slides were mounted with prolong gold antifade reagent and imaged. RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) RNA was extracted from tissues after powdering in liquid nitrogen and lysis in RNAStat60 reagent in a pre- cooled dounce homogenizer. Quantitative PCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 3 qPCR machine (Waltham, MA). Gene expression was calculated based on a cDNA stan- dard curve within each plate and normalized to expression of the geometric mean of housekeeping genes Hprt, Rpl32A, and Tbp. qPCR primers are provided in Supplementary file 3. Immunoblot Detection of proteins by immunoblot was as described previously (Mori et al., 2021). Ex vivo lipolysis Distal tibial BMAT plugs were flushed out from the bone, and four plugs were pooled into one well of a 96- well plate for each n. Pre- warmed 2% BSA HBSS was added to BMAT explants with vehicle (DMSO) or forskolin (FSK, 5 μM), to activate lipolysis (Litosch et al., 1982).

All samples passed the post- alignment quality check (QualiMap v.2.2.1). The DEseq2 method was used for differential expression analysis with genotype (Pnpla2+/+ vs. Pnpla2-/-) and treatment (CR vs. ad libitum) as the main effects. Gene ontology analysis was done using MetaScape. The Principal Compo- nent Analysis (PCA) plot was generated using the PlotPCA function building in DESeq2 package. To compare the number of differentially expressed genes between genotype/treatment groups, volcano plots were constructed using the Enhanced Volcano package under R environment.

{"prompt": "Development, regulation, metabolism and function of bone marrow adipose tissues Ziru Li1, Julie Hardij1, Devika P. Bagchi1, Erica L. Scheller2, and Ormond A. MacDougald1,* 1Department of Molecular & Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, United States 2Division of Bone and Mineral Diseases, Department of Medicine, Washington University, Saint Louis, MO, United States Abstract Most adipocytes exist in discrete depots throughout the body, notably in well-defined white and brown adipose tissues. However, adipocytes also reside within specialized niches, of which the most abundant is within bone marrow. Whereas bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) shares many properties in common with white adipose tissue, the distinct functions of BMAT are reflected by its development, regulation, protein secretion, and lipid composition. In addition to its potential role as a local energy reservoir, BMAT also secretes proteins, including adiponectin, RANK ligand, dipeptidyl peptidase-4, and stem cell factor, which contribute to local marrow niche functions and which may also influence global metabolism. The characteristics of BMAT are also distinct depending on whether marrow adipocytes are contained within yellow or red marrow, as these can be thought of as ‘constitutive’ and ‘regulated’, respectively. The rBMAT for instance can be expanded or depleted by myriad factors, including age, nutrition, endocrine status and pharmaceuticals. Herein we review the site specificity, age-related development, metabolic characteristics and regulation of BMAT under various metabolic conditions, including the functional interactions with bone and hematopoietic cells. Keywords BMAT; site specificity; development; regulation; bone; hematopoiesis Introduction Adipocytes are found in white (WAT) and brown adipose tissues, as well as in bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) and other more minor depots1–4.

BMAT develops in a distinct pattern throughout the skeleton and is dynamically regulated by a variety of physiological and pathological conditions. Herein we delineate the differences between bone marrow adipocytes (BMAs) within red and yellow marrow, which we have defined as regulated (r) and constitutive (c) BMAT, with rBMAT showing more dynamic responses to a variety of conditions. We also review the development and regulation of BMAT in human and rodents under physiological and pathological conditions, explore the local functions of BMAT related to osteogenesis and hematopoiesis, and compare the secretome and lipid composition of BMAT with that of more well-characterized white depots. Development and regulation of BMAT in humans and rodents Continual development of BMAT over the human lifespan BMAT resides within the bone cavity together with hematopoietic cells, trabecular bone, nerve fibers, blood vessels and sinusoidal capillaries6.

The number of adipocytes within bone marrow increases dramatically during postnatal growth, causing the bone color change from red to yellow. In general, expansion of BMAT occurs in a centripetal pattern, beginning in the distal skeleton of the hands and feet. Next, after development of BMAT in the epiphyses of long bones, conversion from red to yellow marrow continues in the diaphyses, which then progresses distally and proximally, with conversion occurring more rapidly at the distal ends7. By the age of 25 years, BMAT occupies 50 to 70% of total bone marrow volume8 with red- to yellow-marrow conversion then continuing at a slower rate throughout the rest of life9. It should be noted that expansion of BMAT over the human lifespan is independent of WAT accumulation, since WAT peaks at middle- or early old age and then declines thereafter10, 11. BMAT in axial skeleton arises later than in long bones. In adults, BMAs are readily observed within red marrow of axial skeleton, including the sternum, ribs, pelvis and vertebral bones2. Within an individual, a gradient of BMAT is observed with development within the sacrum12, and expanding proximally through the lumbar vertebrae13. The temporal replacement of red marrow by yellow marrow with age is shown in Figure 1. Although the general patterning of BMAT development in humans occurs similarly between males and females, the absolute amount of bone marrow fat within vertebrae, sacrum and hips of adult males is higher than in age-matched females12, 14, 15. It should be noted, however, that vertebral BMAT rises sharply in women between 55 and 65 years of age, and is associated with menopause. Thus, in women older than 65 years, vertebral marrow fat content is ~10% higher than in males16. The rise in marrow fat content observed in postmenopausal females is secondary to estrogen deficiency and/or a reduced need for hematopoiesis following cessation of menstruation. Estrogen deficiency due to menopause (or", "completion": ""}

Estrogen replacement reduces accumulation of BMAT in iliac crest by decreasing BMA size, and blocking the increase in BMA number17.

Development of regulated and constitutive forms of BMAT in rodents The development of BMAT in rodents generally follows the centripetal patterning observed in humans; however, distinctions between types of BMAs can be more readily observed in rats and mice than in larger species. We have built on the excellent work of Tavassoli19, 20 to define two groups of adipocytes that are characterized, in part, by their location, how they are regulated, and their cellular properties. We have termed the BMAT within the yellow marrow of distal tibia and caudal vertebra constitutive BMAT (cBMAT). These adipocytes develop soon after birth and are readily observed by one week of age. By standard light microscopy, cBMAT appears essentially indistinguishable from WAT, with BMAs occupying the vast majority of the marrow space. As suggested by the term “constitutive” these cells are much more stable than the regulated BMAs (described below) in the face of a wide variety of nutritional, physiological or genetic interventions. In rodents, rBMAT is located in the red marrow of tibia proximal to the fibula junction, in femur, and in axial skeleton21, 22. Development of rBMAT occurs later than cBMAT, with substantial development observed in C3H/HeJ mice by 12 weeks of age. The rBMAs are observed as single or clustered BMAs that are smaller than cBMAs, and are found interspersed with hematopoietic", "completion": ""}

Development of rBMAT in vertebrae is not observed within mice at baseline8, 23, although marrow adiposity has been detected in lumbar vertebrae of obese ob/ob mice22. Marrow fat fraction and BMA number are also increased by ovariectomy in lumbar vertebrae24, 25 and femur24, 26 of adult rats, respectively. Our working model is that BMAT within rodent paws will be characterized as cBMAT, whereas that within radius and humerus will mainly be rBMAT. Whereas human adult males generally have more BMAT than premenopausal females 14, 15, adult female mice appear to have more rBMAT in tibia than males18, 21, 27. In contrast, cBMAT in distal tibia is similar between sexes18, 21, 27. As in humans, estrogen deficiency in rodents is a strong stimulus for BMAT development18, 28, and whereas ovariectomy increases cBMAT of distal tibia by ~30%, the expansion of proximal tibial rBMAT is far more extensive18, 28. Estrogen is not only necessary to restrain accumulation of BMAT, but exogenous administration of estrogen is sufficient to stimulate rapid loss of marrow adiposity in tibia29. In addition to aging and estrogen depletion/replacement18, 28, 29, rBMAT of rodents is also regulated by many nutritional, environmental, genetic, and endocrine factors. For instance, three weeks of cold exposure stimulates a dramatic and specific decrease in size and number of rBMAs in proximal tibia21. Other specific negative regulators of rBMA size or morphology include fasting30, intracerebral31 or subcutaneous32 leptin, intraperitoneal β3- agonist33, acute myeloid leukaemia34, exercise35 and lactation36, some of which will be discussed in detail later within this review. Although development of rBMAT is independent of the lipodystrophy gene caveolin-1 ( Cav1 ), accumulation of rBMAs in proximal tibia is largely dependent on expression of another lipodystropy gene, cavin-1( Ptrf)21.

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptshowing dynamic depletion of marrow adiposity, rBMAT is also subject to expansion in response to a variety of conditions. For example, mice with high fat diet-induced obesity show much higher osmium staining of proximal tibial marrow lipid than lean mice. Elevated lipid in proximal tibia is due to an increase in both BMA number and size35, 37, 38 (Figure 2). In contrast, neither bone marrow lipid nor the size/number of BMAs is different in distal tibial cBMAT of lean and obese mice (Figure 2). Importantly, overeating of a standard laboratory chow diet also increases rBMAT in rodents with a genetic predisposition for hyperphagia32, 39, 40. Thus, it is the positive energy balance and/or development of obesity that contributes to rBMAT expansion, rather than dietary composition. Expansion of rBMAT is also observed in response to thiazolidinediones41, glucocorticoids42, fibroblast growth factor-2143, type 1 diabetes44 and type 2 diabetes41, 42, and as discussed below, caloric restriction45–47. Whether these disparate signals causing BMAT expansion result in BMAs with similar molecular and physiological characteristics remains unknown. Exercise Mice with access to a wheel will voluntarily run ~10 km per day35, 48. This level of exercise reduces rBMA number and size in both lean and diet-induced obese mice35, suggesting that energy stored within marrow adipocytes is readily mobilized under these conditions. A possible mechanism for rBMA depletion is the specific induction (in whole tibia) of perilipin 3, which has been linked to increased basal lipolysis and β-oxidation. Importantly, perilipin 1 (and 5), which is more effective than perilipin 3 at repressing basal lipolysis, remains unchanged by exercise35. In addition, exercise partially offsets the induction of rBMAT by a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonist48. Caloric restriction Whereas", "completion": ""}
{"prompt": "exercise causes loss of both rBMAT and WAT35, 49, these adipose depots are not uniformly correlated. A particularly interesting divergence is observed in the case of caloric restriction. Despite decreasing subcutaneous and visceral WAT50, caloric restriction (e.g. 30%) causes a dramatic expansion of rBMAT, an observation observed in humans through to rodents45, 51. Expansion of BMAT with caloric restriction contributes to the elevated circulating concentrations of adiponectin45. Although the mechanistic bases for effects of caloric restriction on BMAT remain unknown, a potential cause is increased circulating glucocorticoids27, which have been shown to increase marrow adiposity and decrease bone mass52. Peripheral or intracerebral administration of leptin decreases rBMAT volume31, 32, and leptin administration blocks the increase in rBMAT with calorie restriction53; however, rabbit and rodent data suggest that reduced endogenous leptin concentrations can be dissociated from the BMAT expansion27. The disparate effects of calorie restriction on development and/or metabolism of BMAT and WAT provide compelling evidence that BMAs are developmentally and metabolically distinct from white adipocytes. As described above, cBMAT is largely resistant to stimuli that positively or negatively influence rBMAT; however, this tissue is not immune to moderate expansion (~30%) in response to calorie restriction27 or thiazolidinedione treatment41. Furthermore, cBMA number is modestly depleted by a prostaglandin E 2 receptor type 4 agonist in ovariectomized rats25. Although not measured in rodents, it appears likely that both rBMAT Li et al.

{"prompt": "Functional interactions between BMA and other cells within the bone marrow niche BMAT is undoubtedly an important component of the bone and hematopoietic niches; however, the specific relationships between BMAs and osteoblasts/osteoclasts, and hematopoietic cells have not yet been well-defined in a mechanistic manner. Bone, hematopoietic cells, and BMAT are contained within a closed system, and thus expansion of one of these populations is often at the expense of one or both of the others. Although this reciprocal relationship undoubtedly holds true at the extremes, regulated changes in extracellular fluid volume and cell size may act to buffer the tightness of this ‘zero-sum’ relationship57. Bone Support for a reciprocal relationship between BMAs and bone cells comes from innumerable clinical and animal studies, which generally demonstrate an inverse correlation between BMAT content and bone mass9, 28, 51. This inverse relationship may be driven in part by mesenchymal progenitors having a cell fate choice between BMAs and osteoblasts. Thus, signals that promote adipogenesis (e.g. thiazolidinedione58, dexamethasone52 and fibroblast growth factor-2143) impair osteogenesis, whereas signals that inhibit adipogenesis (e.g. Wnt10b signaling59, 60) promote differentiation of osteoblasts. Although reciprocal regulation of mesenchymal cell fate may explain the expansion of BMAT and reduction of bone mass with age9, the specific proteins and signaling pathways involved have not been delineated. In addition, BMAs per se may secrete factors that repress osteogenesis since in vitro co-culture of osteoblast progenitors with either primary adipocytes or fully- differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes decreases activity of alkaline phosphatase, and expression of the osteogenic transcription factor, runt-related transcription factor-261. Adipogenic cells also secrete factors in vivo that inhibit bone repair62. In this regard, expression of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 in marrow appears to be specifically from adipogenic progenitors and", "completion": ""}
{"prompt": "production increases in distal tibial cBMAT of aged animals. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 impairs osteogenesis in cultured cells, whereas in vivo administration of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors accelerates fracture healing62. Finally, BMAs may also contribute to bone loss by stimulating osteoclast differentiation and activation. For example, in the absence of parathyroid hormone receptor signaling, BMAs secrete receptor activator for NF- κB (RANK) ligand to increase osteoclast activity and bone resorption63. The marked induction by dexamethasone of RANK ligand from BMAs suggests a potential mechanistic link between the chronic use of synthetic steroids and bone loss64. On the other hand, evidence has also accumulated that this inverse relationship between BMAT and bone mass, whilst compelling, may not always be causally linked. For instance, in the absence of BMAT, ovariectomy still causes bone loss in c-kit deficient mice28. Similarly, bone loss is also observed in type 1 diabetic mice in which expansion of BMAT is blocked by a PPAR γ inhibitor65, or leptin administration66, and leptin injection to calorie restricted mice Li et al.

Lastly, certain inbred strains of mice also indicate that the inverse relationship is not universal in that C3H/HeJ mice have both high proximal tibial rBMAT and bone mass, whereas C57Bl/6J mice exhibit low values for both of these variables21. Hematopoiesis Consistent with the closed system discussed above, expansion of BMAT is also generally associated with depletion of hematopoietic cellularity, and vice versa .

In the absence of BMAT, whether by genetic (e.g. A-ZIP/F167) or pharmacological (e.g. PPAR γ inhibitor) means, the reconstitution of hematopoietic progenitor cells and recovery after transplantation was improved23, and favored selective expansion of myeloid and granulocyte populations23. The inverse relationship between BMAT and hematopoietic cellularity may be due, in part, to BMAs competing for space within the marrow cavity. Consistent with this idea, in irradiated mice, implantation of hematopoietic stem cells with adipogenic progenitors or preadipocytes results in reduced regeneration of the hematopoietic stem cell population, perhaps due to increased numbers of BMAs62. In contrast, work by other investigators suggests a supportive role for BMAs in function of hematopoietic cells. For example, in vitro co-culture of Lin− blood cells with adipocytes increased numbers of hematopoietic progenitors and development of mature granulocytes34. Furthermore, in the context of leukemia, regeneration of healthy erythroid progenitors and granulocytes after irradiation was improved in mice in which BMAT was expanded by treatment with a PPAR γ-agonist34. Importantly, the specific secretion of stem cell factor by BMAs, but not white adipocytes, is required in caudal vertebrae for maintenance of hematopoietic cells68. Although BMA-derived stem cell factor is not required for creation of blood cells in non-irradiated mice, the absence of stem cell factor impairs the ability of hematopoietic stem cells from femurs/tibiae and caudal vertebrae to reconstitute donor cells after irradiation. Indeed, knockout of stem cell factor in adiponectin-CRE expressing cells diminishes survival of mice after irradiation and bone marrow transplant68. Whereas adiponectin is well-known to have positive effects on hematopoietic stem cell activation and hematopoietic recovery following irradiation or chemotherapy69, 70, the relative importance of secretion from BMAs versus WAT depots remains unknown. It should", "completion": ""}
{"prompt": "be noted, however, that at least in the case of caloric restriction, BMAT is an important and disproportionate source of circulating adiponectin45. In summary, although one might imagine the reciprocal relationship between BMAs, bone cells and hematopoietic cells to be characterized by mutual antagonism, interactions between BMAT and other cell types within the marrow niche are more complex than this, and many positive (or independent) effects have also been observed. A limitation of studies exploring interactions between BMAT and hematopoiesis is that they largely depend upon irradiation and bone marrow transplantation. Interestingly, irradiation, Li et al. Page 6 Bone . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 May 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptitself, causes a profound wave of marrow adipogenesis in humans71 and rodents72. Regulated BMAs after irradiation are largely derived from resident precursors that were positive for adiponectin expression68. Further evidence that BMAT expansion derives from recipient precursors comes from the absence of BMA expansion in lipodystrophic A-ZIP/F1 mice irradiated and transplanted with wildtype bone marrow cells23. Both of these studies suggest that irradiation-induced BMAs are generated from recipient precursors rather than from donor cells. Interestingly, without irradiation, transplanted mesenchymal progenitor cells homed to marrow and developed into many of the BMAs observed in older recipient mice73. Elevated secretion of a subset of adipokines by BMAT There is no evidence from gene profiling or expression studies that any of the myriad adipokines secreted from WAT are not also expressed by BMAT74, 75. However, differences in relative expression and/or secretion of proteins from WAT and BMAT exist, and likely reflect the distinctive functions and properties of each depot. For example, leptin is well- known to be expressed in proportion to adipocyte size76. Thus, whilst the mRNA for leptin is reported to be reduced (or", "completion": ""}
{"prompt": "unchanged) in BMAs45, 74, this may simply reflect the smaller size of these cells, and the fact that BMAs show only modest hypertrophy in the face of positive energy balance35, 38. In addition, secretion of RANK ligand from BMAs has local effects on osteoclasts63, 77; however, production of RANK ligand is not specific to BMAs and has also been documented from WAT78. Whilst a recent report provides compelling evidence that stem cell factor is expressed by BMAs but not by visceral white adipocytes68, other investigators report detectable expression of the stem cell factor gene, kitl, within WAT and brown adipose tissues79. Inspection of GEO datasets also provides support for detectable expression of kitl in adipose tissues and cultured adipocytes, and suggests that expression of kitl in white adipocytes is similar to that in bone marrow adipocytes74. Finally, elevated secretion of adiponectin is observed from BMAT, despite expression levels of adipoq being similar or lower in BMAT compared to WAT45, 74. With caloric restriction, circulating adiponectin increases, despite a loss of WAT, due to expansion of BMAT and the disproportionate contribution that elevated secretion makes45, 47. Thus, in this case it appears that BMAs may have a mechanism for expressing certain secreted proteins at high levels relative to white adipocytes, despite similar or even lower levels of mRNA. Unsaturated lipid composition of cBMAT The distinct lipid composition of BMAs isolated from red and yellow marrow was first identified in rabbits by Tavassoli et al in 197780. He reported that “ shifts from myristic and palmitic acids (in red marrow) to their respective monounsaturated derivatives myristoleic and palmitoleic acids (in yellow marrow) were found .” These findings generally hold true from humans to rodents21.

Although the physiological relevance of higher unsaturated lipids in BMAT is unclear, clinical studies demonstrate that a lower proportion of BMAT unsaturation is associated with reduced bone mineral density and increased risk of fracture in postmenopausal women81, 82. Summary and future directions It has become clear that BMAT is distinct from other well-characterized adipose depots, such as WAT and brown adipose tissue. In addition to its unique location, BMAT also differs with regards to origin, development, site-specific regulation, cellular character, and function. Although inverse relationships are generally observed between BMAT, bone mass and hematopoietic cellularity within the closed environment of bone, recent mechanistic work sheds light not only on antagonistic interactions, but also highlights numerous positive, supportive interactions between BMAs, and bone and hematopoietic cells. As animal models are developed and/or advanced technologies are applied to the study of BMAT biology, we anticipate rapid advances in our understanding of BMA precursors and development, the genetic and metabolic characteristics of BMAT and WAT, and the interactions between BMAT and other cell types within the bone marrow niche. Translation of these results will improve our understanding and treatment of human diseases affecting bone and blood cells, and may provide therapeutic targets to influence whole body metabolism.

Roles of this pathway in mesenchymal stem cell fate determination and differentiation havebeen extensively studied. Indeed, canonical Wnt signal-ing is a signi ﬁcant endogenous inhibitor of adipogene- sis and promoter of other cell fates, includingosteogenesis, chondrogenesis, and myogenesis. How- ever, emerging genetic evidence in both humans and mice suggests central roles for Wnt signaling in body fatdistribution, obesity, and metabolic dysfunction. Herein,we highlight recent studies that have begun to unravelthe contributions of various Wnt pathway members tocritical adipocyte functions, including carbohydrate andlipid metabolism. We further explore compelling evi- dence of complex and coordinated interactions be- tween adipocytes and other cell types within adiposetissues, including stromal, immune, and endothelialcells. Given the evolutionary conservation and ubiqui-tous cellular distribution of this pathway, uncoveringthe contributions of Wnt signaling to cell metabolism has exciting implications for therapeutic intervention in widespread pathologic states, including obesity, diabe-tes, and cancers. Historically, adipose tissue was considered to be an inert organ primarily responsible for storage of excess energy. Ability to store nutrients for mobilization during periodswhen demands exceed caloric intake is an evolutionarily preserved function; indeed, energy storage as cytoplasmic triacylglycerol is conserved from Saccharomyces cerevisiae toDrosophila melanogaster toHomo sapiens (1).

Wnt signaling is an ancient pathway used by multicel- lular animals from the earliest metazoans to mice to humans, with central roles in development and mainte-nance of diverse cell types and tissues (5). MammalianWnt signaling is complex: 19 Wnts, 10 frizzled recep-tors, and two Lrp coreceptors on the cell surface are accompanied by an intricate network of intracellular components and innumerable downstream molecular re-sponses. To date, studies have established the Wnt/b-catenin pathway as a critical endogenous inhibitor of adipocyte differentiation (6).

Since then, inter- est in Wnt signaling and its fundamental functions in or- ganismal biology has grown steadily. In 1991, mutation in theApcgene, which encodes adenomatous polyposis coli(APC), was identi ﬁed as the genetic cause of familial ade- nomatous polyposis, a hereditary cancer syndrome.Shortly thereafter, APC was found to interact directlywith the central Wnt signaling protein, b-catenin, pro- viding a direct connection between Wnt signaling andhuman disease (9). To date, aberrant Wnt signalinghas been implicated in diverse pathologic processes, including development disorders, cancers, and degen- erative diseases (10,11).

During synthesis, Wnt proteins, which are/C2430–40 kDa in size, undergo extensive post-translational processing, including N-glycosylation, pal- mitoylation, and palmitoleoylation, to ensure proper se-cretion and function (12) (Fig. 2 A).

Thus, the canonical Wnt signaling machinery is also highly operative in terminally differentiated adipocytes.diabetes.diabetesjournals.org Bagchi and MacDougald 1423Once secreted, hydrophobic Wnt proteins have limited abilities to diffuse in the extracellular environment andthus act mainly through autocrine/paracrine mechanisms.Several pathways can be activated by binding of Wnts to their receptors, including the canonical Wnt/ b-catenin, noncanonical Wnt/calcium, and planar cell polarity path-ways. Of these, the best studied is the canonical pathway,which regulates activation of Wnt target genes throughstabilization of the central signaling protein b-catenin (14) (Fig. 3 A). The majority of endogenous intracellular b-catenin is bound to E-cadherin and a-catenin at adherens junctions,whereas a small pool exists as free cytosolic b-catenin. As- sociation of b-catenin with E-cadherin protects it from binding to a multiunit destruction complex comprised of Axin, APC, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), protein kin- ases casein kinase 1 a(CK1a) and glycogen synthase 3 b (GSK3 b), and the E3 ligase b-TrCP.

The half- life of free cytosolic b-catenin is on the order of minutes, whereas the pool associated with adherens junctionsturns over slowly; thus, free cytosolic b-catenin is the Wnt-responsive signaling pool. When Wnts bind to their membrane-spanning frizzled (Fzd) receptors and LDL receptor –related protein (LRP) coreceptors, they trigger an intracellular signaling cascadethat disrupts the destruction complex and prevents phos-phorylation of free cytosolic b-catenin, thereby promoting its stabilization. Accumulated b-catenin then translocates to the nucleus to associate with DNA-binding TCF/LEF proteins, which act as transcriptional switches (16). In the absence of Wnt signals, TCF/LEF factors form complexeswith groucho/transducin-like enhancer of split (TLE) toact as transcriptional repressors. Binding of b-catenin physically displaces groucho/TLE, forming bipartite TCF/b-catenin coactivators that then mediate transcription of downstream Wnt target genes (Fig. 3 B).

Similarly, overexpression in preadipocytes of Pygo2, a nuclear promoter of b-catenin/TCF/LEF tran- scription, mediates b-catenin signaling to inhibit adipo- genesis, whereas Pygo2 deletion induces spontaneousdifferentiation (21). Although b-catenin is often consid- ered to function exclusively as a canonical Wnt effector, itcan also signal through unrelated pathways in certain con-texts (6). In response to testosterone, for example, b-cate- nin binds to the androgen receptor and is subsequentlyshuttled to the nucleus to coactivate TCF/LEFs and inhib-it adipocyte differentiation (22). Additionally, tumor ne-crosis factor a(TNFa) treatment blocks differentiation ofpreadipocytes by stabilizing b-catenin and enhancing TCF7L2-dependent transcription, suggesting that b-cate- nin mediates effects of in ﬂammatory cytokines on adipo- genesis (23). Conversely, inhibition of Wnt signaling in precursor cells promotes adipogenic differentiation. Indeed, treat- ment of preadipocytes with soluble Wnt inhibitors such as secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1) or SFRP2, or overexpression of negative pathway regulators, such as axin, dickkopf 1, or dominant-negative TCF4, results in spontaneous differentiation into adipocytes (24).

Secreted Wnt inhibitors includeSFRPs, dickkopfs, sclerostin, and Wnt inhibitory factor 1(Wif1); of these, SFRPs are the most well studied in adi-pose tissues. Due to their structural similarity to frizzledreceptors, SFRPs bind to and sequester extracellular Wnt proteins, thus blocking binding and downstream signaling. Of the ﬁve SFRP family members, SFRP1 and SFRP5 are upregulated during adipogenesis. Further, high Sfrp5 ex- pression is a strong predictor of increased adiposity inC57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Consistent withthis, SFRP5 expression is highly upregulated speci ﬁcally in adipocytes by diet-induced obesity. Global deletion of Sfrp5 in mice stabilizes Wnt signaling and confers resistance to genetic or diet-induced obesity (55).

Wls is an evolutionarily conserved, multipass, trans- membrane protein dedicated to intracellular traf ﬁcking of Wnts to the plasma membrane for secretion (58) (Fig.2A). After Wnts are produced, the covalent addition of acyl moieties at the ER renders Wnt proteins hydrophobicand limits their mobility through the secretory pathway.Wls is localized throughout the Wnt secretory route, in-cluding the ER, Golgi apparatus, intracellular vesicles, andplasma membrane. Thus, Wls binds modi ﬁed Wnts at the ER and Golgi apparatus and facilitates their movement throughout the cell to the plasma membrane for extracel-lular release (Fig. 2 B). Importantly, palmitoleoylation at conserved Ser209 on Wnt proteins is thought to be re-quired for binding to Wls; mutants lacking this lipid mod-iﬁcation are unable to interact with Wls and are thus retained at the ER.

Further investigation re-veals that this is due to a compensatory mechanism bywhich surrounding stromal vascular cells sense the loss ofadipocyte-derived Wnt secretion and respond by upregu-lating various Wnt mRNAs. Thus, stromal vascular cells ofWls /C0//C0mice have elevated Wnt target gene expression compared with those of control mice, and Wnt signaling is maintained within Wls-de ﬁcient adipocytes. Intriguing- ly, this compensatory mechanism is overcome by HFDfeeding, revealing that Wls /C0//C0mice have decreased WAT mass, smaller adipocytes, and improved glucose toleranceand insulin sensitivity (59). b-Catenin: The Central Player in Canonical Wnt Signaling Canonical Wnts signal through the central protein b-cate- nin to mediate downstream target gene expression inwidespread tissues (Fig. 3). Recently, genome-wide associ-ation studies in humans have linked CTNNB1 gain-of- function mutations to increased obesity risk (53). Further,two independent investigations targeted adipocyte-specif-ic deletion of b-catenin in mice to uncover the contribu- tion of canonical Wnt signaling to mature adipocytefunction (53,54). These studies revealed that b-catenin deletion suppresses expression of canonical Wnt targetand lipogenic genes, in part through regulation of keytranscription factors Srebf1 and Mlxipl . Thus, similar to Wls-de ﬁcient adipocytes, b-cat /C0//C0cells are characterized by impaired fatty acid desaturation and lipogenesis. In vivo, b-catenin deletion does not appear to affect systemic metabolism in chow-fed mice. However, Bagchiet al. (54) found sustained expression of b-catenin mRNA and protein within adipocytes despite complete ablationat the genomic level. Consistent with this, Chen et al.(53) also reported substantial expression of Ctnnb1 mRNA in adipocytes isolated from WAT of knockout mice.

Further, consistent with Ctnnb1 ex- pression patterns, downstream Wnt targets are alsoincreased in this cell population. Thus, these data suggestthat a subset of CD45 /C0/CD31/C0stromal cells are able to sense and respond, directly or indirectly, to the loss of ad-ipocyte b-catenin, such that chow-fed mice maintain nor- mal metabolic function. Interestingly, HFD feeding overrides this compensatory mechanism and b-catenin expression is ablated in adipo- cytes isolated from knockout mice. Both Chen et al. andBagchi et al. reported remarkably consistent data showingthatb-catenin knockout mice challenged with HFD are resistant to diet-induced obesity. Indeed, b-cat /C0//C0mice have decreased weight gain and adiposity, improved glu- cose handling and insulin sensitivity, and protection from hepatosteatosis. Wnt Target Gene Tcf7l2 Wnt/b-catenin mediates downstream gene expression pri- marily through coactivation of TCF/LEF transcription fac- tors. To date, TCF/LEF family member Tcf7l2 is one of the strongest genetic risk factors associated with develop- ment of type 2 diabetes in humans. Several groups have recently sought to explore mechanisms by which Tcf7l2 regulates metabolism by generating three distinct models of adipocyte-speci ﬁcT c f 7 l 2a b l a t i o n( 6 1 –63).

Geoghegan et al.

Possible bases for differences in results include varied ge- netic strategies or alternative gene splicing. However, the overarching results suggest that Tcf7l2 regulates adipo- cyte hypertrophy and systemic metabolism. Discussion and Future Perspectives The role of Wnt signaling in MSC fate determination and differentiation is well established (6). Indeed, the prepon- derance of data within the ﬁeld of adipose biology to date has characterized Wnt inhibition of adipogenesis and pro- motion of other cell fates, including osteoblastogenesis, chondrogenesis, and myogenesis. However, increasing ge- netic evidence in humans has linked various Wnt pathway members to body fat distribution, obesity, and metabolic dysfunction. In recent years, a ﬂurry of global and adi- pose-targeted studies in mice has provided compelling, al- beit in some cases contradictory, evidence that Wnt signaling plays important roles in accumulation of adipose tissues and in whole-body glucose and lipid metabolism, particularly under obesogenic conditions (53 –55,59,61 –63). Indeed, adipocyte-speci ﬁc deletion of various Wnt pathway members, including Ctnnb1 ,Wls,a n d Tcf7l2, has been shown to in ﬂuence lipogenic gene expression, underscoring1428 Wnt Signaling in Cell Metabolism Diabetes Volume 70, July 2021the critical importance of Wnt signaling in adipocyte lipogenesis. These studies also point toward Wnt signaling being re- quired for other adipocyte functions. Indeed, gene set en-richment analyses of differentially expressed genes have identi ﬁed several metabolic pathways as being downregu- lated with b-catenin deletion, including those involved in glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid,", "completion": ""}
{"prompt": "cho- lesterol, and bile acid metabolism (54). Further, RNA-se- quencing analysis revealed that Tcf7l2 regulates many metabolic pathways in WAT, including cholesterol, fatty acyl-CoA and triacylglycerol biosynthesis, and amino acid, carbohydrate, and peroxisomal lipid metabolism (61). Thus, it is conceivable that various Wnt signaling mem- bers in ﬂuence unique networks of metabolic pathways in adipocytes. Indeed, interaction between effects on distinct pathways may explain, in part, differences observed be- tween reported phenotypes of impaired Wnt signaling in adipocytes. These works also reveal that intercellular Wnt signaling forms a nuanced and ﬂexible system for moni- toring and regulating the state of adipose tissue metabo- lism and other functions. Thus, disruption of the Wnt pathway is compensated for on a tissue level, and it is only when these compensatory mechanisms are overrid- den that effects on global metabolism are observed. In addition to their fundamental contributions to whole-body homeostasis and widespread physiologic pro- cesses (Fig. 1), adipose tissues also in ﬂuence growth and progression of many malignancies (64). Tumors requirelarge sources of energy to facilitate rapid cell division, which may explain, in part, why many invasive cancers oc- cur in close proximity to adipose depots. Indeed, a distinc- tive feature of oncogenic transformation is metabolic reprogramming, with increased production and use of monounsaturated fatty acids. Upregulation of SCD1 has been observed in many cancers and is correlated with in- creased aggression and worsened outcomes (65). Interest- ingly, Wnt/ b-catenin signaling in mature adipocytes regulates a wide network of lipogenic genes, including Fasn and Scd1, thus promoting de novo lipogenesis and production of monounsaturated fatty acids. One intrigu- ing possibility is that Wnt-mediated fatty acid production in adipocytes contributes to cancer pathogenesis.

To investigate the function of laminA/C in adipose tissue, we created mice with an adipocyte-speci ﬁcl o s so f Lmna (Lmna ADKO). Although LmnaADKO mice develop and maintain adipose tissues in early post- natal life, they show a striking and progressive loss of white and brown adipose tissues as they approach sexual maturity. LmnaADKOmice exhibit surprisingly mild meta- bolic dysfunction on a chow diet, but on a high-fat dietthey share many characteristics of FPLD2 includinghyperglycemia, hepatic steatosis, hyperinsulinemia, andalmost undetectable circulating adiponectin and leptin. Whereas Lmna ADKOmice have reduced regulated and constitutive bone marrow adipose tissue with a concomi-tant increase in cortical bone, FPLD2 patients havereduced bone mass and bone mineral density comparedwith controls. In cell culture models of Lmna deﬁciency, mesenchymal precursors undergo adipogenesis withoutimpairment, whereas fully differentiated adipocytes have increased lipolytic responses to adrenergic stimuli. Lmna ADKOmice faithfully reproduce many characteristics of FPLD2 and thus provide a unique animal model toinvestigate mechanisms underlying Lmna -dependent loss of adipose tissues.

{"prompt": "mostcommon form of monogenic lipodystrophy is familial partial lipodystrophy type 2 (FPLD2), which is caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the Lmna gene encoding nuclear lamins A and C. FPLD2 patients generally have heterozygousor compound heterozygous variants affecting exons 8 and 11 of Lmna . Variants in exon 8, including position R482, are associated with 80% of FPLD2 cases and produce a severelipodystrophic phenotype (10 –14). Strong disease pheno- types have also been described for autosomal-dominant non-R482 single missense mutations and for homozygous pathogenic variants; less severe metabolic disease pheno-types have been associated with mutations in other Lmna exons (15,16). Although Lmna mutations alter functional aspects of nuclear structure, chromosome organization, and transcription factor activity, mechanisms by which lamin A/C mutations cause lipoatrophy remain incompletelyunderstood. Overexpression of wild-type lamin A or R482 mutants in 3T3-L1 cells is suf ﬁcient to inhibit preadipocyte differ- entiation (2). Transgenic mice that overexpress the most common FPLD2 Lmna mutation (R482Q) in adipose tis- sue have characteristics similar to the human phenotype,including loss of adipose tissue, glucose intolerance, insu-lin resistance, and fatty liver; however, these phenotypes develop slowly and are relatively mild, even on a high-fat diet (HFD) (1). On the other hand, precursor cells isolatedfrom lamin /C0//C0mice also have diminished capacity for adi- pogenesis, as do induced pluripotent stem cells lines derived from patients with FPLD2 (5,17), and mice with global deletion of Lmna lack white adipose tissue (WAT). 1Department of Molecular & Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 2Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology and Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI Corresponding author: Ormond A.

Thus, more sophisticated animal models arerequired to evaluate mechanisms of lipoatrophy, sinceboth gain- and loss-of-function approaches for lamin A/Cmutations cause impaired adipogenesis of cultured cellsand depletion of adipose tissue in mice. Herein we report that mice with selective deletion of ﬂoxed Lmna in adipocytes ( Lmna ADKO)d e v e l o pf u n c t i o n a l WAT and brown adipose tissue (BAT) depots postnatallybut lose the vast majority of adipocytes coincident withsexual maturity. While both male and female Lmna ADKO mice develop lipoatrophy and metabolic dysfunction, effects are more pronounced on an HFD and in females,mirroring the sex differences observed in FPLD2 patients.Although the phenotype of Lmna ADKOmice is highly cor- related with clinical signs of FPLD2, some characteristicsare more reminiscent of acquired generalized lipodystro-phy. In addition, cortical bone mass is increased inLmna ADKOmice, whereas we observed reduced bone mass in FPLD2 patients. Adipogenesis of primary Lmna- deﬁ- cient precursors is not impaired; however, adrenergic-stimulated lipolysis of resulting adipocytes is slightlyincreased. Together, these data in mice demonstrate that when knocked out during adipogenesis, lamin A/C is not required for development of adipocytes early in life but isnecessary for the maintenance of adipose tissue and met-abolic homeostasis in adulthood.

RESULTS Lmna Deletion in Adipocytes Causes Loss of Adipose Tissue To investigate the importance of lamin A/C in adipose tis- sue, we developed a model to delete Lmna in adipocytes (LmnaADKO) by breeding Adipoq-Cre mice with mice con- taining ﬂoxed Lmna alleles ( LmnaFL) (Supplementary Fig. 1A–E). We con ﬁrmed through genotyping and immuno- blot analyses that lamin A/C is lost speci ﬁcally from adipo- cytes of sWAT in mice at 4 weeks of age (Supplementary Fig. 1 BandE). To determine whether recombination of exons 10 and 11 results in a truncated lamin protein, weinfected cultured mesenchymal precursors from Lmna FL mice with an adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase (Adeno-Cre) or GFP (Adeno-GFP) prior to adipogenesis.

We then asked whether the mRNA expression of truncated Lmna might be altered in cells treated with Adeno-Cre and observed that mutant Lmna was expressed comparably to wild-type Lmna mRNA (Supplementary Fig. 1 D). These data suggest that the truncated protein is rapidly degraded. At 12 –14 weeks of age, visual inspection revealed that male LmnaADKOmice have a striking loss of WAT, includingpsWAT, anterior sWAT, and gWAT (epididymal or ovarian) depots (Fig. 1 Aand Supplementary Fig. 1 F). In addition, interscapular BAT was smaller and whiter in appearance. The livers of LmnaADKOwere enlarged and paler in color (Fig. 1 Aand Supplementary Fig. 1 F).

Consistent with visual inspec- tion, loss of lamin A/C in adipocytes led to a profoundreduction in weight of psWAT, gWAT, and mesenteric,pericardial, renal, and retroperitoneal WAT in both sexes(Fig. 1 Dand Eand Supplementary Fig. 1 F;d a t an o t shown).

Histological analyses of WAT remnants from Lmna ADKOmice revealed an almost complete loss of adipocytes, along with anincrease of ﬁbrotic stroma (Fig. 1 H).

We did not detect a phenotype in heterozygous LmnaFL/1;Adipoq-Cre mice (data not shown), consistent with previous ﬁndings that heterozygous global null Lmna1//C0mice do not have lipoa- trophy or metabolic dysfunction (26). Taken together,these data demonstrate that loss of lamin A/C in adipo-cytes causes a lipoatrophic phenotype in mice. On a Chow Diet, LmnaADKOMice Exhibit Only Mild Metabolic Dysregulation FPLD2 patients have signi ﬁcant metabolic complications including clinical diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver dis- ease (7 –9); thus, we next investigated effects of adipo- cyte-speci ﬁc loss of lamin A/C on whole-body metabolism in mice. Surprisingly, glucose tolerance of LmnaADKOmice was not different between genotypes, although area under the curve suggested glucose intolerance in female mice (Fig. 2 AandBand Supplementary Fig. 2 A). Whereas fast- ing blood glucose concentrations were elevated inLmna ADKOmice of both sexes (Fig. 2 C), glucose and insu- lin concentrations were only higher in random-fed femalemice (Fig. 2 CandD). Adiponectin was undetectable in the serum of Lmna ADKOmice (Fig. 2 E), but there was only a trend toward reduced leptin concentrations (SupplementaryFig. 2 B). Adipocyte-speci ﬁc deletion of Lmna led to increased serum triacylglycerols in female mice and decreased glycerolin both sexes (Fig. 2 FandG). We next measured circulat- ing glycerol concentrations following administration of isoproterenol.

Taken together, these results indicate that LmnaADKOmice have a mild dysregulation of glucose and lipid metabolism that ismore pronounced in females than in males. Dramatic energy balance alterations have been observed in other mouse models of lipodystrophy, including a“ﬂattened ”respiratory exchange ratio (RER), hyperphagia, metabolic in ﬂexibility in switching between oxidation of car- bohydrates and fat, and changes in energy expenditure(27–30). We therefore used CLAMS analyses to investigate energy balance in female Lmna FLandLmnaADKOmice/C246 months of age. RER in the LmnaADKOanimals remained constant at /C240.9 throughout the light and dark cycles, in stark contrast to the cyclical RER observed in control ani- mals (Fig. 2 I).

Food consumption, water consumption, and phys- ical activity were not altered in LmnaADKOanimals (Supplementary Fig. 2 M; data not shown). Adipocyte-Specific Deletion of Lmna Causes Loss of BMAT and Increased Cortical Bone Whether lipoatrophy extends to BMAT depends on the underlying cause; BMAT is lost in patients with mutations in AGPAT1 or seipin but is maintained in patients with mutations in caveolin or cavin1 (31). In FPLD2 patients,MRI scans suggest that BMAT is also comparable to thatof healthy controls (32). To determine whether adipocyte-speciﬁc loss of lamin A/C in ﬂuences BMAT, we histologi- cally evaluated the marrow niche following bone decalci ﬁ- cation. We observed a striking loss of regulated bonemarrow adipocytes in the distal femur and proximal tibia(Fig. 3 AandBand Supplementary Fig. 3 A) and a surpris- ing decrease in constitutive BMAT of distal tibia and cau-dal vertebra (Fig. 3 CandD), which generally are resistant to depletion (25). Indeed, quanti ﬁcation with osmium staining revealed a signi ﬁcant reduction in distal tibial BMAT of both male and female animals (SupplementaryFig. 3 B). Clinical correlations often show a reciprocal rela- tionship between BMAT and bone mass (33). mCT analy- sis of distal tibia revealed increased cortical area and cortical thickness in female Lmna ADKOmice (Fig. 3 E–G), although no differences were observed in trabecular bonevariables of proximal tibia (Supplementary Fig. 3).Together, these data indicate that in mice, lamin A/C isrequired for development or maintenance of regulated and constitutive BMAT and that loss of BMAT is associ- ated with an increase in cortical bone, although the sys-tematic effects could not be excluded.FPLD2 Patients With R482 Mutations Have Reduced Fat Mass, Bone Mass, and Bone Mineral Density To determine whether FPLD2 patients also have increased bone, we retrospectively", "completion": ""}

Averageage of the control and R482 groups was /C2450 years, with /C2470% women in both cohorts (Supplementary Fig. 4 A). Unlike Lmna ADKOmice on a normal chow diet, the human population had substantial metabolic dysfunction; 76.2%of R482 patients had type 2 diabetes, and 71.4% werediagnosed with fatty liver, whereas 23.8% and 19.0% of controls were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and fatty liver, respectively. All patients with R482 mutations haddyslipidemia, compared with 40.5% of patients in thecontrol group. Serum triglycerides were signi ﬁcantly higher in R482 patients (Supplementary Fig. 4 B), and HDL cholesterol levels were lower in this group (Supp-lementary Fig. 4 A). Although patients with R482 patho- genic variants were not different in weight, height, BMI, trunk mass index, or fat-free mass index (Fig. 4 Aand Supplementary Fig. 4 A), the fat mass index and trunk fat mass index were signi ﬁcantly lower in the R482 group (Supplementary Fig. 4 AandC). As expected, fat mass of FPLD2 patients was signi ﬁcantly lower in arms, legs, trunk, and total body (Fig. 4 A). Interestingly, bone mineral density was lower in R482 patients (Fig. 4 B), and bone mass of the arms, legs, trunk, and total bodywere also signi ﬁcantly lower in patients with R482 mutations (Fig. 4 C–F). These data indicate a discor- dance between effects on bone of lamin A/C de ﬁciency inLmna ADKOmice and global mutations of LMNA on R482 in humans. Thus, reduced bone mass in humans may be secondary to metabolic dysfunction or perhaps R482 mutation in osteoblasts or other nonadipocytepopulations.

When observed at 4 weeks of age, psWAT and gWAT appeared normal upon gross examination (Fig. 6 Aand Supplementary Fig. 6 A). Total body weight was unaffected by loss of lamin A/C in adipocytes at 4 weeks of age (Supplementary Fig. 6 B). Although weight of psWAT mass was not different in either sex at 2 weeks of age, female LmnaADKOmice had reduced psWAT at 4 weeks of age, and both sexes had less psWAT at 6 weeks of age, compared with LmnaFLcon- trols (Fig. 6 B). In histological examination of psWAT and gWAT, gross abnormalities were not detected (Fig. 6 C), but histomorphometric analysis revealed smaller adipocytes in female but not male LmnaADKOmice at 4 weeks of age (Fig. 6 D). Livers of LmnaADKOmice at 4 weeks of age did not have an obvious difference in appearance (Fig. 6 AandC and Supplementary Fig. 6 A), and their weights were not statistically increased (Supplementary Fig. 6 C). Whereas BAT appeared grossly similar between LmnaFLand LmnaADKOmice at 4 weeks of age (Fig. 6 A), histological analyses revealed an increase in lipid droplet size at that time (Fig. 6 C). Weights of gWAT and spleen were not dif- ferent between LmnaFLandLmnaADKOmice at 4 weeks of age (Supplementary Fig. 6 DandE). On the basis of ourobservation of reduced circulating glycerol concentrations in adult LmnaADKOmice (Supplementary Fig. 2 C), we mea- sured responses to isoproterenol in LmnaFLandLmnaADKO mice at 4 weeks of age. There were no differences in concen- trations of circulating free glycerol at baseline between experimental groups, but LmnaADKOmice displayed a decreased lipolytic response to isoproterenol treatment at60 min (Supplementary Fig. 6 F). We also observed an apparent increase in number of stromal cells in psWAT and gWAT of Lmna ADKOmice at 4 weeks of age, which we hypothesized represented immunecell in ﬁltration (Fig. 6 C).

We also performed immuno ﬂuorescent stain- ing to observe macrophages (Mac2) and adipocytes (Cav1) inpsWAT tissue of Lmna FLandLmnaADKOmice at 6 weeks of age but did not detect marked differences in number ofMac2 1cells between genotypes or in frequency of crown-like structures, a hallmark of adipocyte turnover (Fig. 6 E). These data suggest that increased appearance of stromal vascular cells may be secondary to reduced size of adipocytes. We did, however, con ﬁrm our previous observation of smaller adipo- cytes in psWAT and gWAT depots of young LmnaADKOmice. Furthermore, LmnaADKOmacrophages were larger and more clustered (Fig. 6 E). Together these results demonstrate that adipose tissue develops postnatally in LmnaADKOmice and is progressively lost starting at /C244 weeks of age and continuing through sexual maturity, which closely mirrors FPLD2 disease progression in humans. Lmna Deletion Does Not Affect Adipogenesis of Primary Mesenchymal Precursors To interrogate molecular mechanisms underlying loss of adipose tissue in LmnaADKOmice, we induced deletion of Lmna in mesenchymal precursors isolated from LmnaFL mice with an adenovirus expressing either Cre recombi- nase (Adeno-Cre) or GFP as a negative control (Adeno- GFP). PCR con ﬁrmed ef ﬁcient recombination of the Lmna ﬂoxed allele with Adeno-Cre treatment (Supplementary Fig. 7 A).Lmna deletion had no effect on adipogenesis or morphology of mature adipocytes even when cultured forup to 28 days (Fig. 7 A), despite almost complete loss of lamin A/C protein (Fig. 7 B). Lamin A/C Deficiency Increases Lipolysis of Cultured Adipocytes Next, we asked whether Lmna deletion in cultured adipo- cytes affects cellular function. We hypothesized that loss of lamin A/C in adipocytes might increase lipolysis basedon the decrease in size of adipocytes in psWAT ofLmna ADKOmice (Fig. 6 D).

Effects of lipo- lytic stimuli on glycerol release were correlated with corre- sponding increases in phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase, as well as perilipin and phosphorylation of proteinkinase A substrates (Fig. 7 D). Whereas total hormone- sensitive lipase was increased in adipocytes lacking lamin A/C, changes in ATGL or adiponectin were not observed (Fig. 7 D). We then investigated fatty acid uptake in Lmna - deﬁcient cultured adipocytes and found that functional lamin A/C is not required for entry into adipocytes of pal- mitic acid (Supplementary Fig. 7 D). On the basis of our observation of increased circulating glucose and insulinconcentrations in Lmna ADKOmice (Fig. 5 DandE), we con- sidered whether Lmna deletion in cultured adipocytes would affect cellular responses to insulin stimulation; however, no differences were observed in baseline or insu-lin-stimulated glucose uptake or in stimulation of phos- phorylated AKT (Supplementary Fig. 7 BandC). These ﬁndings indicate that lamin A/C is not required for adipo- genesis, but loss of lamin A/C does increase sensitivity ofadipocytes to lipolytic stimuli. DISCUSSION Taken together, our ﬁndings demonstrate that adipocyte- speciﬁc loss of lamin A/C in mice yields a phenotype that closely mirrors that observed in human FPLD2 patients.In both cases, development of adipose tissues appears to occur normally, but depots are progressively lost during sexual maturation, with almost complete depletion atolder ages. Lipoatrophy in Lmna ADKOmice is accompanied by ectopic lipid accumulation in BAT and liver, as well as increased circulating glucose and insulin and decreased circulating concentrations of adiponectin, leptin, and glyc-erol. Furthermore, these mice demonstrate a", "completion": ""}

The metabolic dysfunction observed inLmna ADKOmice is not as extreme as that observed in FPLD2 patients or in other mouse models of lipoatrophy (34 –38), even after 5 weeks of HFD; however, it is likely that a longer-term feeding of HFD would further worsenthe impaired glucose and lipid homeostasis. The major discrepancies between Lmna ADKOmice and FPLD2 patients are the extent of lipodystrophy and effects on bone. Whereas LmnaADKOmice have increased cortical bone, we show herein that FPLD2 patients havewidespread loss of skeletal bone mass and bone mineral density. We speculate that older Lmna ADKOmice on a long-term HFD might have greater metabolic dysfunctionand a corresponding loss of cortical and trabecular bone. Alternatively, increased bone in LmnaADKOmice may be secondary to reductions in regulated and constitutive BMAT, another variable that differs between LmnaADKO mice and FPLD2 patients. A vast majority of FPDL2 cases are caused by a single point mutation (R482) in the Lmna gene, which is predominantly believed to act in a domi-nant-negative manner (40,41). Although Lmna haploin- sufﬁciency does not cause either lipoatrophy or metabolic disease (26), the close parallels between Lmna ADKOmice and FPLD2 patients suggest that the R482 mutationlikely causes a loss of lamin A/C function. Important questions that remain to be answered include the bases for progressive loss of WAT and BAT and whether sexual maturity plays a causative role, giventhe timing and sexual dimorphism. While it may be thatpostweaning development of adipocytes requires lamin A/ C, and that adipose attrition simply re ﬂects normal turn- over without adipocyte replacement, our data providestrong support for a model in which lamin A/C is not nec- essary during adipogenesis for the embryonic/early post- natal development of adipose tissues. This idea issupported by our observation that lamin", "completion": ""}
{"prompt": "A/C is not required for adipogenesis of cultured primary mesenchy- mal precursors. We considered whether loss of lamin A/Cmight increase targeting of mature adipocytes by immune cells, but our evaluation of stromal vascular cell popula- tions and tissue macrophages did not provide evidence tosupport this notion. Finally, it could be that lamin A/Cdeﬁciency is required for maintenance of the mature adi- pocyte phenotype and that apparent attrition is the result of negative energy balance or adipocyte death; however,our experiments suggest that mice lacking functional lamin do not have higher energy expenditure or altered food intake on a chow diet. Additional experiments willbe required to distinguish between these possibilities, but the smaller adipocyte size observed in 4-week-old Lmna ADKOmice and elevated lipolytic response to adre- nergic stimuli of cultured adipocytes support a catabolic metabolic mechanism. In summary, we report the novel ﬁnding that loss of lamin A/C in adipocytes causes a phenotype in mice similar to human FPLD2. Although the underlyinggenetics differ greatly between Lmna ADKOmice and FPLD2, and opposing effects on bone and BMAT are observed, this is the ﬁrst mouse model that mimics many of the characteristics of human FPLD2.
